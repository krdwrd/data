     The Yakima UFO Field project was undertaken by me in August of</pre><pre>
1972 at the request of Dr. J. Allen Hynek.  The study has</pre><pre>
continued to this day.</pre><pre>
</pre><pre>
     The original reports were not widely circulated by Dr. Hynek</pre><pre>
at my request.  However, a number of articles and at least one book</pre><pre>
related to the Toppenish Study have been published over the years.</pre><pre>
This electronic distribution is my attempt to make the original</pre><pre>
documents of the study available to anyone who is interested.</pre><pre>
</pre><pre>
     This distribution contains the text of three papers:  The first</pre><pre>
was submitted in November of 1972.  Two follow-up reports, in 1974</pre><pre>
and 1975, summarize developments and report statistics following</pre><pre>
the conclusion of the initial field study.  The original</pre><pre>
typewritten documents were scanned and converted to electronic media</pre><pre>
files with OCR software.  Otherwise, they appear essentially as they</pre><pre>
did in their original form.</pre><pre>
</pre><pre>
     December of 1995 marks twenty-three years since the Toppenish</pre><pre>
Field Study was undertaken.  Bill Vogel and Allen Hynek have died.</pre><pre>
Many of the other people who contributed to it have moved on to new</pre><pre>
jobs, retired or died.  This publication is dedicated to Bill Vogel</pre><pre>

INTRODUCTION</pre><pre>
</pre><pre>
     This report presents findings made during a field study period</pre><pre>
extending from August 20, 1972 to August 31, 1972, near Toppenish,</pre><pre>
Washington U.S.A.</pre><pre>
</pre><pre>
     It is intended as a preliminary report, since investigation is</pre><pre>
still in progress.  The report begins with a description of the</pre><pre>
study area.  The following section presents a short history of UFO</pre><pre>
activity in the region.  The next section deals with the objectives</pre><pre>
of the study, the investigative approach employed and instruments</pre><pre>
used.  Detailed reports of each observation of apparent UFO</pre><pre>
activity made by this investigator comprise the fourth section of</pre><pre>
the report.</pre><pre>
</pre><pre>
     The final section of this report includes some preliminary</pre><pre>
assessments concerning the effectiveness of the study and some</pre><pre>
suggestions for improving equipment for present and future</pre><pre>
investigations.  Care has been taken to report all unusual</pre><pre>
observations as accurately as possible and to refrain from</pre><pre>
analysis.</pre><pre>
</pre><pre>
     Appendix A summarizes additional observations by other</pre><pre>
individuals during the year of 1972, prior to the initiation of the</pre><pre>
field study described in this report.</pre><pre>
</pre><pre>
</pre><pre>
DESCRIPTION OF THE STUDY AREA</pre><pre>
</pre><pre>
     The area involved in this study consists of a rectangular</pre><pre>
section, about forty miles wide and seventy miles long (2,800 sq.</pre><pre>
miles), located in south central Washington state.  Almost all of</pre><pre>
the area is a part of the reservation of the Yakima Indian Nation.</pre><pre>
Approximately two-thirds of the reservation is closed to the public</pre><pre>
and special authorization is required to enter the area.</pre><pre>
</pre><pre>
     Eastern borders of the study area are marked by the towns of</pre><pre>
Parker, Wapato, Toppenish, Granger and Mabton.  The western border</pre><pre>
is formed by the eastern slopes of the Cascade mountain Range, with</pre><pre>
Mount Adams (elevation 12,307 ft.) the dominating feature of the</pre><pre>
skyline.  The northern border of the area is marked by Ahtanum</pre><pre>
Ridge (4,5OO ft.).  Bickleton Ridge and the Simcoe Mountains (max.</pre><pre>
elevation 5,500 ft.) from the southern border.  Figure I is a map</pre><pre>
of the study area.</pre><pre>
</pre><pre>
     The eastern quarter (144,325 acres) of the region is used for</pre><pre>
agricultural purposes; the principal crops being sugar beets, hops,</pre><pre>
mint, asparagus, corn, peas, grain, alfalfa, cherries, peaches,</pre><pre>
apples and grapes.  This quarter is flat valley farmland.  The</pre><pre>
remaining portion of the eastern half or the valley is used for</pre><pre>
rangeland and consists mainly of dry, rolling hills.</pre><pre>
</pre><pre>
     The western half of the study area is made up of heavily</pre><pre>
forested terrain, much of it primitive and inaccessible to normal</pre><pre>
ground transportation.  Timber from this region is a major source</pre><pre>
of income for the area.  Railroad tracks of the Burlington Northern</pre><pre>
Line run along the eastern border of the reservation.  U.S. Highway</pre><pre>
97 is the only major freeway in the area and, along with primary</pre><pre>
power transmission lines of the Bonneville Power Administration,</pre><pre>
cuts through the southeastern corner of the reservation.</pre><pre>
</pre><pre>
     Secondary roads, many of them dirt or gravel, crisscross the</pre><pre>
reservation.  The town of White Swan, twenty miles due west of</pre><pre>
Toppenish, is the most western population center in the area and</pre><pre>
has about 300 inhabitants.  The closest areas of industrial</pre><pre>
significance are the nuclear research facilities at Hanford, 28</pre><pre>
statute miles to the northeast, and the Yakima Firing Range, 14</pre><pre>
statute miles to the north of Toppenish.</pre><pre>
</pre><pre>
     Geology of the study area is interesting:  Marine fossils</pre><pre>
found in the area indicate that the entire valley might once have</pre><pre>
been a huge lake or inland sea.  Volcanic activity is still very</pre><pre>
much in evidence, especially in the vicinities of Mt. Adams and</pre><pre>
neighboring Mt. Rainier.</pre><pre>
</pre><pre>
</pre><pre>
HISTORY OF UFO PHENOMENA IN THE STUDY AREA</pre><pre>
</pre><pre>
     Activity recognizable as classical UFO phenomena has been</pre><pre>
present in the Toppenish area for more than eight years.  There is</pre><pre>
even some evidence to suggest that UFO reports are a part of Yakima</pre><pre>
Indian legends.  A detectable increase in activity has taken place</pre><pre>
in the last three years.  Reports have recently been made by law</pre><pre>
enforcement personnel from the Washington Stare Patrol, County</pre><pre>
Sheriff and reservation Law and Order department.  Formerly, fire</pre><pre>
lookouts had been the primary source of reports.  A majority of</pre><pre>
observations are made at night and consist mostly of the typical</pre><pre>
"nocturnal light" (NL) phenomenon described by Hynek(1).  Primary</pre><pre>
characteristics of this particular phenomenon include:</pre><pre>
          1.  Generally bright light, larger than a point source.</pre><pre>
</pre><pre>
          2.  Colors reported cover the entire spectrum, but most</pre><pre>
               usually are yellow-orange.</pre><pre>
</pre><pre>
          3.  Kinematics are not attributable to balloons,</pre><pre>
              aircraft or other natural objects and often give</pre><pre>
              the appearance of intelligent action.</pre><pre>
</pre><pre>
     The NL in the Toppenish study area have generally conformed to</pre><pre>
the above description.  The Toppenish manifestation does seem to</pre><pre>
differ slightly in that it is frequently observed on or near the</pre><pre>
ground.  Predominant colors range from brownish-orange to pure</pre><pre>
white.  Investigation of prior NL activity in the study area</pre><pre>
revealed that a few daytime observations have been made.  These</pre><pre>
daylight sightings are very rare and have ranged from "fuzzy"</pre><pre>
appearing "blobs" to well-defined, metallic colored,</pre><pre>
disk shaped objects of the classical "flying saucer" variety.</pre><pre>
There was also one ten year old report of a physical impression</pre><pre>
made in the ground by an UFO.</pre><pre>
</pre><pre>
</pre><pre>
DESCRIPTION OF STUDY OBJECTIVES AND METHODS</pre><pre>
</pre><pre>
     Preparations for the Toppenish project began in April of 1972,</pre><pre>
following a survey of the extent of activity in the area by Dr. J.</pre><pre>
A. Hynek.  It was determined at this time that the activity was of</pre><pre>
sufficient quality and regularity to justify placement of an</pre><pre>
observer equipped with instruments in the area during a period of</pre><pre>
expected peak activity.  The Yakima Tribal council and the Yakima</pre><pre>
Agency, Bureau of Indian Affairs, along with the Agency Forestry</pre><pre>
Division gave their full cooperation to the project and plans were</pre><pre>
made to conduct a field study during the month of August (a period</pre><pre>
of prior high sighting probability).</pre><pre>
</pre><pre>
     A primary objective of the study was to determine the</pre><pre>
feasibility of "staking-out" a scientific observer in an area of</pre><pre>
high sighting probability, with the purpose in mind of obtaining</pre><pre>
hard data concerning UFO phenomena.</pre><pre>
</pre><pre>
     First priority was assigned to obtaining photographs,</pre><pre>
including spectrographs and position data.  It was felt that this</pre><pre>
information would be of greatest use as scientific information and</pre><pre>
the easiest to acquire, given the transient nature of the</pre><pre>
phenomenon under study.  Another priority was the acquisition of</pre><pre>
data relating to any magnetic effects which might arise from UFO</pre><pre>
activity.</pre><pre>
</pre><pre>
     The investigative approach used involved setting-up portable</pre><pre>
observation points at selected locations in the study area for</pre><pre>
several days at a time.  This technique allowed the observer to</pre><pre>
become acquainted with normal activity in a given location and</pre><pre>
prepare him to detect any abnormal activity which might occur.  No</pre><pre>
concerted effort was made to "chase" the phenomenon around the</pre><pre>
reservation.  Instead, it was allowed to come to the observer.  The</pre><pre>
temporary observation points and instruments were manned during the</pre><pre>
times of greatest sighting probability, i.e., between sunset and</pre><pre>
sunrise.</pre><pre>
</pre><pre>
     Additional time, during the day, was spent gathering</pre><pre>
background data, such as previous sighting reports, geographical</pre><pre>
and other supportive information.  Accent was placed on flexibility</pre><pre>
of method, because of the large area to be covered and the</pre><pre>
elusiveness of the phenomenon under investigation.  The</pre><pre>
investigator's presence was purposely made as unobtrusive as</pre><pre>
possible to avoid interference with routine business on the</pre><pre>
reservation.</pre><pre>
</pre><pre>
     Observation points were established at six points in the study</pre><pre>
area.  Three of these locations were adjacent to Satus, Signal Peak</pre><pre>
and Sopelia fire lookouts (Slide Nos. l, 2 and 3, respectively).</pre><pre>
The remaining observation points were positioned in the valley near</pre><pre>
White Swan.  All of the observation points are numbered on the map</pre><pre>
of Figure I.  (Satus, Signal Peak and Sopelia lookouts are numbered</pre><pre>
5, 4 and 6, respectively.)</pre><pre>
</pre><pre>
     The Tribal Forestry Division radio system was available for</pre><pre>
communication between the investigator and fire lookouts.  It was</pre><pre>
intended that such a communication link might provide a means of</pre><pre>
triangulating the position of a NL, should a sighting occur.  All</pre><pre>
transmissions were coded because of previous reports of apparent NL</pre><pre>
responses to radio messages concerning them.  When Possible, radio</pre><pre>
transmissions were avoided to keep from disturbing personnel who</pre><pre>
monitor the 110 unit radio network on a twenty-four hour basis</pre><pre>
during the fire season.</pre><pre>
</pre><pre>
     All observation points were accessible by means of roads.</pre><pre>
However, a sturdy car was required to traverse them.  The fire</pre><pre>
lookout locations afforded  excellent visibility to the</pre><pre>
investigator and were free from  interfering lights.  Valley</pre><pre>
observation points were often subject to interfering lights and</pre><pre>
haze, but afforded the best views of ridges where much of the NL</pre><pre>
activity had been previously reported.</pre><pre>
</pre><pre>
     The instruments used included two single lens reflex (SLR)</pre><pre>
cameras, a 16mm motion picture camera, a 35mm range finder camera,</pre><pre>
a compass spin detector, recording magnetometer, standard time</pre><pre>
receiver and tape recorder.  Other instruments for measuring</pre><pre>
nuclear radiation, infrared radiation, ultrasonic sound and</pre><pre>
frequency references were available, but not normally deployed.</pre><pre>
</pre><pre>
     One of the SLR cameras was fitted with a 500mm, f8</pre><pre>
catadioptric design lens.  This camera/lens combination had a 5</pre><pre>
degree field of view and served as the primary instrument for recording</pre><pre>
visible light data (Slide No. 4).</pre><pre>
</pre><pre>
     The motion picture camera was normally fitted with an 18-86mm,</pre><pre>
f2.7 zoom lens, but could be operated with the same 500mm lens used</pre><pre>
on the still camera. The second SLR camera was equipped with a 55mm</pre><pre>
lens and replica grating to permit recording of spectral data.</pre><pre>
(Slide No. 5, right).  These three cameras used Kodak High speed</pre><pre>
Ektachrome, Type B (EFB) film.</pre><pre>
</pre><pre>
     EFB film was selected because of its high exposure index, good</pre><pre>
resolution characteristics and reasonable exposure latitude.  It</pre><pre>
was also found that the "B" emulsion gave the best color balance</pre><pre>
under night exposure conditions.</pre><pre>
</pre><pre>
     The range finder camera (Slide No. 5, left) was loaded with</pre><pre>
black and white Kodak High Speed infrared film and equipped with a</pre><pre>
Wrattan 89B filter.  This camera could record radiation in the</pre><pre>
near-infrared spectrum (wavelengths 750 to 900 nanometers).</pre><pre>
</pre><pre>
     The standard time receiver picked-up National Bureau of</pre><pre>
standards time signals and served as a time reference for</pre><pre>
measurements.  An electronic compass spin detector was also</pre><pre>
deployed during the observation periods.  Signals from both devices</pre><pre>
were fed into the tape recorder, along with the observer's</pre><pre>
commentary.  The latter instruments are shown in a typical field</pre><pre>
set-up in Slide No. 6.</pre><pre>
</pre><pre>
     An automatic recording magnetometer, designed and built by the</pre><pre>
San Diego section of the Aerial Phenomenon Research Organization</pre><pre>
(APRO), was also used during the field study period.  This device</pre><pre>
required some initial setup, but afterwards was capable of</pre><pre>
unattended operation.  Its primary features were high sensitivity</pre><pre>
to changes in magnetic flux, wide frequency response (to 1000 Hz)</pre><pre>
and the ability to detect rotational force vectors of possible</pre><pre>
paramagnetic nature.</pre><pre>
</pre><pre>
</pre><pre>
OBSERVATIONS OF NL ACTIVITY MADE DURING THE STUDY PERIOD</pre><pre>
</pre><pre>
     A number of observations of apparent NL activity were made by</pre><pre>
this investigator during the field study period.  Many of them were</pre><pre>
recorded on film.  This section catalogs the sightings</pre><pre>
chronologically.  Slides which are applicable to the particular</pre><pre>
observation are referenced by number.  All time is recorded in</pre><pre>
Greenwich Mean Time, 24 hour format.  All dates are given at</pre><pre>
location.  Headings from observation points are magnetic (add 20</pre><pre>
degrees for true headings).</pre><pre>
</pre><pre>
OBSERVATION I</pre><pre>
Date: 8-20-72</pre><pre>
Observer Location:  Point 1 (Figure I)</pre><pre>
Activity Location:  Point A (Figure I)</pre><pre>
</pre><pre>
     One luminous, round light was observed at 0415 on a bearing of</pre><pre>
240 degrees  from the observer.  It was joined by another similar</pre><pre>
light at 0437.  They were at an elevation of 10-20  and well below</pre><pre>
the ridge of the hills.  Their apparent location was north of Hunt</pre><pre>
Creek and west of the Job corps camp, at an estimated distance of 19</pre><pre>
statute miles.  Topography of the area is rugged, dry hills.</pre><pre>
</pre><pre>
     Sky at the time of the first observation was Partially</pre><pre>
overcast in cumulus, with openings to the south and overhead.  The</pre><pre>
moon was high in the sky and intermittently visible through the</pre><pre>
overcast.  Temperature was about 65 degrees F and surface wind was</pre><pre>
from the NW at between 0 and 5 mph during the observation period.</pre><pre>
</pre><pre>
     The two objects were apparently round, with a reddish-orange</pre><pre>
glow and no clearly defined outline.  The diffuse glow was evenly</pre><pre>
distributed over the surface of each object and no discontinuities</pre><pre>
were visible.  The light flickered noticeably, in much the same way</pre><pre>
as a flare might look when subjected to a strong wind.  The object</pre><pre>
would appear and disappear as if being switched "on" and "off".</pre><pre>
Color hue and saturation appeared to remain constant as the light</pre><pre>
flickered, but perceived size appeared to change.</pre><pre>
</pre><pre>
     Movement of the objects was erratic and discontinuous.  They</pre><pre>
appeared to move independently, circling and changing places in</pre><pre>
relation to one another.</pre><pre>
</pre><pre>
     The lights operated below the ridge of the hill at all times</pre><pre>
during the observation.  They were last seen at approximately 0510.</pre><pre>
Intensities gradually diminished and time between "on" cycles</pre><pre>
became longer until they were no longer visible.</pre><pre>
</pre><pre>
     Four slides were obtained during the observation period.  The</pre><pre>
camera was stationary during the whole sequence.  Slide Nos. 7-10</pre><pre>
were taken at 0437:48, 0438:16, 0439:35 and 0432:46, respectively.</pre><pre>
Exposure was  second through the 500mm, f8 lens.  The film (EFB)</pre><pre>
was processed for its normal, ASA 125 rating.  Slide No. 11 is an</pre><pre>
enlargement of Slide No. 8.  Note the presence of two objects on</pre><pre>
this slide.</pre><pre>
</pre><pre>
     The unusual kinematics and physical appearance of these</pre><pre>
objects strongly indicates that they did not arise from mundane</pre><pre>
causes, such as car or motorcycle lights.</pre><pre>
</pre><pre>
</pre><pre>
OBSERVATION II</pre><pre>
Date : 8-21-72</pre><pre>
Observer Location:  Point 2 (Figure I)</pre><pre>
Activity Location:  Points B and C (Figure I)</pre><pre>
</pre><pre>
     Equipment was set up in a field west of the intersection of</pre><pre>
Wesley and Branch Roads, northwest of White Swan.  This location</pre><pre>
was chosen in an attempt to get closer to the activity observed on</pre><pre>
the previous night.  At 0405, what appeared to be automobile tail</pre><pre>
lights were seen moving on a heading of 20 degrees from the observation</pre><pre>
point (Point 8 of Figure I).  No headlights were visible.</pre><pre>
</pre><pre>
     The red lights appeared to be near the base of the hill, at an</pre><pre>
estimated distance of 5 miles.   (Note: There is a road in this area.)</pre><pre>
The tail lights stopped moving and, shortly thereafter, two</pre><pre>
luminous, amber "balls" came rapidly down from near the top of</pre><pre>
Ahthanum Ridge, circled around each other and approached the red</pre><pre>
lights.  All of the lights next went out, suddenly and</pre><pre>
simultaneously.  The whole observation lasted less than two minutes</pre><pre>
and no sounds were heard.</pre><pre>
</pre><pre>
     At 0512, two "vehicles" with red lights were observed moving</pre><pre>
rapidly up and down the hill side, approximately 10 degrees to the</pre><pre>
left of the first observation.</pre><pre>
</pre><pre>
     Their distance was again about 5 miles from the observer.</pre><pre>
Each "vehicle" had what appeared to be an amber headlight which</pre><pre>
swept rapidly back and forth over the ground ahead of its path.</pre><pre>
The actual source of the "headlight" was never seen, regardless of</pre><pre>
whether the object was going up or down the hill.  Only</pre><pre>
the beam cast on the ground by this "headlight" and the red light</pre><pre>
were visible.  The objects appeared to move independently of each</pre><pre>
other and traversed the distance from near the base of the hill to</pre><pre>
the top of the ridge (approximately 900 ft. of elevation), at an</pre><pre>
angle of 60 degrees to horizontal in less than ten seconds.</pre><pre>
</pre><pre>
     Again, no sound was heard.  The objects disappeared from view</pre><pre>
about ten minutes later.  Weather was almost completely overcast</pre><pre>
with cumulus clouds,  Openings in the overcast could be seen to the</pre><pre>
northwest and southwest.  A thunderstorm was building to the</pre><pre>
southeast.</pre><pre>
</pre><pre>
     Another object appeared on a bearing of 270 degrees at 0619</pre><pre>
(Point C on Figure I).  It was a large brownish-orange ball,</pre><pre>
apparently positioned above Rattlesnake Ridge.  It might have been</pre><pre>
taken for a planet except for the fact that it was under the overcast.</pre><pre>
It appeared to flicker slightly and remained stationary.</pre><pre>
</pre><pre>
     The object disappeared in the observer's field of vision, as</pre><pre>
if it were a light being turned-off.  Estimated time for this</pre><pre>
observation was five minutes.</pre><pre>
</pre><pre>
</pre><pre>
OBSERVATION III</pre><pre>
Date :  8-22-72</pre><pre>
Observation Location:  Point 3 (Figure I)</pre><pre>
Activity Location:  Point D (Figure I)</pre><pre>
</pre><pre>
     A luminous orange ball, similar to the one observed on 8-20-72</pre><pre>
was seen at 0352 on a bearing of 250 degrees from the observation Point,</pre><pre>
This object appeared to be stationary and was near the base of the</pre><pre>
hill.  It blinked on and off several times.  Slide No. 12 was</pre><pre>
taken with a  second exposure through the 500mm, f8 lens.  Again,</pre><pre>
EFB film was used and processed for normal ASA.  The top of the</pre><pre>
ridge is shown and a mercury vapor street lamp appears at the lower</pre><pre>
left of the frame.  The unknown object is to the right.  Slide No.</pre><pre>
13 is an enlargement of the mercury vapor light and object.</pre><pre>
(Note:  Chromatic aberration in this slide is a result of the copy</pre><pre>
process.)</pre><pre>
</pre><pre>
     The light was closer in color to white than orange.  It was</pre><pre>
difficult to determine whether the object in this case was a</pre><pre>
motorcycle headlamp or "genuine" NL.  The source appears to be too</pre><pre>
bright and large for a motorcycle headlamp.</pre><pre>
</pre><pre>
</pre><pre>
OBSERVATION IV</pre><pre>
Date:  8-24-72</pre><pre>
Observer Location:  Point 5 (Figure I)  Satus Fire Lookout</pre><pre>
Activity Location:  Point E (Figure I) Piscoe Meadow</pre><pre>
</pre><pre>
     At 0510, the investigator and fire lookout spotted one (?)</pre><pre>
bright white light moving very rapidly through a wooded area</pre><pre>
southeast of Piscoe Meadow (bearing approximately 358 degrees true).</pre><pre>
Distance to the sighting area was about 18 miles.</pre><pre>
</pre><pre>
     The light moved so fast that it gave the impression of a</pre><pre>
streak.  It would appear stationary for a moment, then, almost</pre><pre>
instantaneously, appear some distance away (typically 10 degrees</pre><pre>
of arc through 7x50 binoculars).  After another brief pause, it</pre><pre>
would dart back in the opposite direction.  When stationary, the</pre><pre>
object appeared through the binoculars as an intense pinpoint of</pre><pre>
white light.</pre><pre>
</pre><pre>
     The sky was clear and the moon was rising, but there was</pre><pre>
considerable haze in the valley.  All car lights observed this</pre><pre>
evening had an orange cast.  The observation lasted about one</pre><pre>
minute and no photographs were obtained.</pre><pre>
</pre><pre>
     A radio message from an observer in the valley was received at</pre><pre>
0730.  He asked the fire lookout if the investigator was "up and</pre><pre>
around."  The lookout's reply was affirmative and the transmission</pre><pre>
was terminated.</pre><pre>
</pre><pre>
     The following day it was learned that the observer in the</pre><pre>
valley had spotted a tan or light orange, slow moving light from</pre><pre>
the freeway near the town of Parker (18 miles NE of the lookout).</pre><pre>
It moved slowly down the valley to the town of White Swan, turned</pre><pre>
and appeared to move directly over the Satus lookout.  It next</pre><pre>
turned and headed east, where it disappeared behind Toppenish</pre><pre>
Mountain.</pre><pre>
</pre><pre>
     The person in the valley assumed that the observer at the fire</pre><pre>
lookout could not have missed the object and he did not want to</pre><pre>
make any direct mention of the object over the radio.</pre><pre>
</pre><pre>
     Nothing was seen from the observation point at Satus lookout</pre><pre>
before or after the radio message.  There was no reasonable way the</pre><pre>
light could have been missed by the investigator and the fire</pre><pre>
lookout.  Yet, nothing was seen.  The observer in the valley is</pre><pre>
known to be extremely reliable and there is no reason to doubt his</pre><pre>
word.  This "non-observation" rates very high on the strangeness</pre><pre>
scale.</pre><pre>
</pre><pre>
</pre><pre>
OBSERVATION V</pre><pre>
Date:  8-26-72</pre><pre>
Observer Location:  Point 5 (Figure I) Satus Fire Lookout</pre><pre>
Activity Location:  Point F (Figure I) near Dry creek</pre><pre>
</pre><pre>
     Intermittent lights were observed along the ridge southeast of</pre><pre>
Satus Lookout for much of the night.  They seemed to appear and</pre><pre>
disappear at random and were thought to have been lights from cars</pre><pre>
or campers.  sky was clear with bright moonlight.  Haze was</pre><pre>
moderate in the lower elevations.</pre><pre>
</pre><pre>
     A 2.5 minute time exposure was taken of the area between 0845</pre><pre>
and 0847 with the 500mm, f8 lens and EFB film.  Slide No. 14 is the</pre><pre>
result.  The two(?) lights appearing on the slide were not seen</pre><pre>
during exposure.  Note that the microwave antenna on the relay</pre><pre>
station also appears dimly in the left hand foreground of the</pre><pre>
picture.  Slide No. 15 is an enlargement of No. 14.</pre><pre>
</pre><pre>
     The closest ridge from the point where the slide was taken is</pre><pre>
about 5 miles away.  Knowing the distance to the ridge and angle</pre><pre>
of view of the lens (5 degree), it should be possible to determine</pre><pre>
whether or not the light source was a car.  Further analysis of</pre><pre>
this slide is needed.</pre><pre>
</pre><pre>
</pre><pre>
OBSERVATION VI</pre><pre>
Date:  8-31-72</pre><pre>
Observer Location:  Point 1 (Figure I)</pre><pre>
Activity Location:  Point C (Figure I) At first observation</pre><pre>
</pre><pre>
     A luminous ball, identical in color and kinematics to that</pre><pre>
observed on 8-20-72 was seen at 0518 on a bearing of 240 degrees</pre><pre>
from the observation point.  The object moved through an arc of</pre><pre>
about 10 to 15  in three minutes.  It appeared to follow the hills,</pre><pre>
about ll miles away, and was situated vertically about half of the way</pre><pre>
between the base and top of Ahtanum Ridge.</pre><pre>
</pre><pre>
     Slide No. 16 is a 60 second time exposure made through the</pre><pre>
500mm, f8 lens.  Slide No. 17 is an enlargement of No. 16.  Note</pre><pre>
how the object appears to move in "spurts" or flicker (there were</pre><pre>
no known obstructions between the object and camera during the</pre><pre>
exposure).</pre><pre>
</pre><pre>
     The object was seen briefly again by this investigator at</pre><pre>
0739.  It was apparently on or near the side of the hill, directly</pre><pre>
below and in line with a microwave tower 8 miles due north of the</pre><pre>
observation point (Point G).  The object was clearly visible</pre><pre>
through binoculars and appeared as a sharply defined,</pre><pre>
brownish-orange disc.  It gave the impression of being flat and the</pre><pre>
ground near it could be seen illuminated by the glow.  The object</pre><pre>
disappeared by "turning-off" before the camera could be trained on</pre><pre>
it.  The foregoing observations could not be accounted for in</pre><pre>
normal terms.  One additional observer verified the sighting.</pre><pre>
</pre><pre>
</pre><pre>
SUMMARY</pre><pre>
</pre><pre>
     The primary objective of demonstrating the feasibility of the</pre><pre>
"stake-out" technique of UFO field investigation appears to have</pre><pre>
been met during the study period.  Nocturnal light activity was</pre><pre>
observed and recorded on film.  Unfortunately, the closest activity</pre><pre>
was at a distance of about eight miles.</pre><pre>
</pre><pre>
     The long working distance did not permit the acquisition of</pre><pre>
any physical data other than a few slides.  However, given the</pre><pre>
technical and position data available, it should be possible to</pre><pre>
arrive at a reasonable estimate of the size, light output and form</pre><pre>
of the objects observed.  It is in this area that primary effort is</pre><pre>
needed.</pre><pre>
</pre><pre>
     This investigator is satisfied that genuine NL activity has</pre><pre>
been and is still taking place on a more or less regular basis in</pre><pre>
the Toppenish area.  However, there was nothing in the nocturnal</pre><pre>
light observations made during the study which would suggest</pre><pre>
conclusively that the source of the activity is extra terrestrial.</pre><pre>
On the other hand, something very unusual is taking place.  The</pre><pre>
problem warrants continued very careful and objective examination.</pre><pre>
</pre><pre>
     A few words should be said concerning the measurements -- or</pre><pre>
lack of measurements -- made during the study period:  One camera</pre><pre>
was responsible for all of the "hard" data obtained,  The only</pre><pre>
other camera capable of working at the distances involved was the</pre><pre>
16mm camera/500mm lens combination.  It was discovered early,</pre><pre>
however, that the motion picture camera could not be aimed</pre><pre>
with the very dim light available.  The reason is that the reflex</pre><pre>
viewing system in the camera, utilizing a half-silvered prism, did</pre><pre>
not transmit enough light to the viewfinder.  (The camera has since</pre><pre>
been fitted with an auxiliary viewfinder.)</pre><pre>
</pre><pre>
     All of the NL activity was too far away to permit</pre><pre>
spectrograms, because of the relatively short focal length lenses</pre><pre>
required by the replica grating.  Additional work is being done on</pre><pre>
spectrograph instrumentation which will allow working longer</pre><pre>
distances.</pre><pre>
</pre><pre>
     The use of the tape recorder for commentary and time logging</pre><pre>
was invaluable in determining the times at which photographs were</pre><pre>
made and recalling details of observations.  A great deal of</pre><pre>
information would have been lost without the time and recording</pre><pre>
equipment.</pre><pre>
</pre><pre>
     There were no abnormal magnetic disturbances sensed by</pre><pre>
instruments at any time during the study period.  The compass spin</pre><pre>
detector was deployed most of the time during observation periods</pre><pre>
and no anomalous compass deflections were sensed.  The recording</pre><pre>
magnetometer was used less than the compass spin detector, because</pre><pre>
of its extreme sensitivity to normal magnetic disturbances.  The</pre><pre>
instrument appears to have potential, however, and a separate</pre><pre>
report dealing with the instrument will be forthcoming.</pre><pre>
</pre><pre>
     In conclusion, a great deal in the line of hard, practical</pre><pre>
experience has been gained from this study.  It was learned what</pre><pre>
things would work - what would not.  Hopefully, the mistakes made</pre><pre>
during this initial study period can be avoided in the next.</pre><pre>
</pre><pre>
     At any rate, study of the activity in the Toppenish area will</pre><pre>
continue indefinitely until some explanation for the phenomena</pre><pre>
there is obtained.</pre><pre>
</pre><pre>
     All material collected during the study period, including the</pre><pre>
original slides, is available for inspection by any qualified</pre><pre>
investigator.  Questions, suggestions and comments will be</pre><pre>
welcomed.</pre><pre>

APPENDIX A</pre><pre>
SUMMARY OF REPORTS FOR THE PORTION OF 1972 PRIOR TO THE FIELD STUDY</pre><pre>
</pre><pre>
</pre><pre>
1.   Date: June 7, 1972 -- Between 9:30 and 12:30 am local time</pre><pre>
     Activity location: South fork of Toppenish Canyon (7 miles</pre><pre>
     from the observer)</pre><pre>
</pre><pre>
     Summary:</pre><pre>
        Spherical shaped object going up and down,</pre><pre>
        bouncing.  Had a bluish "metal-flake blue") sheen and was at</pre><pre>
        least 30 to 40 feet across.  Disappeared with big flash of</pre><pre>
        light arcing into air.  Weather was towering cumulus with 7%</pre><pre>
        cloud cover.  Wind from SW at  5 mph (2:00 pm reading).</pre><pre>
        Visibility was 12 miles.  Cloud-to-cloud lightning observed</pre><pre>
        after 2 pm.  Note: Pet dog reacted strangely, as if its ears</pre><pre>
        were hurting, for approximately one hour on the evening</pre><pre>
        following the observation.  Nothing was visible on the latter</pre><pre>
        occasion.</pre><pre>
</pre><pre>
</pre><pre>
2.   Date: June 29, 1972 -- 10:20 pm local time</pre><pre>
     Activity location: Red Butte</pre><pre>
</pre><pre>
     Summary:</pre><pre>
        Object sat for about 10 minutes.  "Kind of pear-</pre><pre>
        shaped" with fairly  sharp outline.  About four minutes before</pre><pre>
        it moved, yellow, red and green lights were observed.  The</pre><pre>
        object was sitting motionless and then shot straight up to a</pre><pre>
        high altitude.  Object next shot straight east.  Sharp angular</pre><pre>
        motion and very high speed.  Weather was clear, with variable</pre><pre>
        westerly wind.  Visibility was 17 miles.</pre><pre>
</pre><pre>
</pre><pre>
3.   Date: July 31, 1972 -- 9:05 pm local time</pre><pre>
     Activity location: South slope of Shinando Canyon</pre><pre>
</pre><pre>
     Summary:</pre><pre>
        Baseball sized, very white light floating along just</pre><pre>
        below tree top level.  No noise as object moved slowly from</pre><pre>
        west to east.  Observer was above the tree tops in the canyon</pre><pre>
        and above the object.  Distance to the object was less than</pre><pre>
        one-half mile.</pre><pre>
</pre><pre>
</pre><pre>
4.   Date: August 2, 1972 -- 9:10 pm local time</pre><pre>
     Activity location: Yego Pasture</pre><pre>
</pre><pre>
     Summary:</pre><pre>
        Big "blob" with no definite shape.  Observed for</pre><pre>
        ten minutes before it shot straight up, made an</pre><pre>
        instantaneous turn and shot north,  Weather clear, NE wind.</pre><pre>
        Humidity 35 and lower, with 15 mile visibility,</pre><pre>
</pre><pre>
</pre><pre>
5.   Date: August 3, 1972 -- between 10:00 and 11:15 pm</pre><pre>
     Activity location:  NE of fire lookout (Satus)</pre><pre>
</pre><pre>
     Summary:</pre><pre>
        Big, white, bright "thing", something like a cloud</pre><pre>
        came and went.  It would appear dim, then become brighter</pre><pre>
        and brighter, and then. "like something melting fast",</pre><pre>
        disappear.  Angle of elevation was 300 and object was fairly</pre><pre>
        close to lookout.  Bright streaks or rays came from the object</pre><pre>
        and lighted up the interior of the lookout, making things</pre><pre>
        inside visible,  The sky was dark above and below the object.</pre><pre>
        Size of the object was estimated to be as large as the lookout</pre><pre>
        (about 12x12x8 feet).  No moon was visible.</pre><pre>
</pre><pre>
</pre><pre>
6.   Date:  August 11, 1972 -- 12:30 pm local time</pre><pre>
     Activity location:  1000 to 2000 feet above observer</pre><pre>
</pre><pre>
     Summary:</pre><pre>
        Hemispherical object with multicolored, stippled</pre><pre>
        streamers observed below cloud cover.  Observed less than a</pre><pre>
        minute and disappeared almost instantaneously into clouds.</pre><pre>
</pre><pre>
</pre><pre>
