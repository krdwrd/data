           <h4>Intro</h4>
		   This tutorial will help you getting used to the annotation guidelines.
		   It assumes you are familiar with the
           <a href="https://krdwrd.org/manual/html/" onclick="window.open(this.href, 'KrdWrdManual', 'resizable=true,scrollbars=yes,status=no,toolbar=yes'); return false;">manual</a>
           (click to open in a new window, suitable for side-by-side viewing with this one. Or print the
           <a href="https://krdwrd.org/manual/manual.pdf">pdf</a>).
           <h4>How it works</h4>
           <p>
           The tutorial pretty much works like annotation on a real corpus:
           you annotate a website, submit it, and get the next one. <br />
           However, we inserted a validation step after submission:
           You will stay at the current page and we will show you how your annotations diverged from ours.
           </p>
           <p>
           Everything you got right will be left untouched, as it appeared on the original site, without any annotation.
           Everything you got wrong will be highlighted as it was supposed to be.
           Please take your time to go through this feedback carefully - you won't get any when working on the real corpus.
           </p>
           <p>
           After inspection, you can click the <i>Next Page</i> button in the notification box at the top, or just use <i>Grab Page from Tutorial</i> from the KrdWrd status-bar menu, to advance.
           You can return to your last tutorial step any time by hitting <i>Start Tutorial</i> once again.
           Reset it by deleting your annotations on your <i>My Stats</i> page.
           </p>
           <h4>Start the tutorial</h4>
           Now let's get going.
           Move around your mouse on this page.
           <i>You did that right from the start, didn't you? Busy little bees you are!</i>
           You should get fancy highlighting wherever you go. 
           Annotate some of the text here to get used to the keyboard shortcuts.
           <br />
           Then click on <i>Submit</i> in the KrdWrd menu.
           You will get back to this page, with the validation result.
           Hit <i>Next Page</i> then to get going with real pages.
