                        industrialized nations, some of them members of the 
                        Atomic Club, decided last week in Paris to step up plans

                        risked breaking international law and said participating

                        the Ville de Virgo, a French-owned ship carrying 214 
                        aluminum tubes that serve as gas-centrifuge components 
                        for enriching uranium for nuclear bombs, was intercepted 
                        on tips from French and German intelligence agencies as 
                        it was entering the Suez Canal. The shipment, procured 
                        in Germany and unloaded in the Egyptian port of 
                        Alexandria, was destined for North Korea. </kw><br><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">German 
                        police arrested the owner of a small export company and

                        such pipes. Investigators said they had concluded that 
                        that amount of aluminum in North Korean hands could have 
                        yielded about 3,500 gas centrifuges for enriching 
                        uranium. A Western diplomat said the intentions "were 
                        clearly nuclear ... The result could have been several 
                        bombs' worth of weapons-grade uranium in a year."

                        deadly nerve agent tabun, also purchased in Germany, one 
                        of the world's leading producers and exporters of toxic 
                        gas, was arrested and inspected before reaching

                        he signed it," said Rastislav Kacer, a former Slovak 
                        deputy defense minister who helped lead an investigation 
                        into a similar attempt by North Korea to buy 
                        sophisticated radar equipment. "Documents that are fake 
                        can be made to appear very real," he added, quoted by 
                        Joby Warrick in the Washington Post of August 14.

                        history of exporting arms, one participant said. 
                        </kw><br><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">Experts on atomic proliferation say the above 
                        two examples are the tip of the iceberg in the huge and 
                        lucrative underground WMD market, as many other 
                        shipments reach their destinations without being 
                        inspected. </kw><br><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">"The clandestine market for atomic, 
                        biological and chemical [ABC] arms as well as missiles 
                        capable of delivering them is very big," said a French 
                        anti-terrorist expert, adding that despite existing 
                        international treaties and tough controls on the export 
                        of such materials, not only regimes that have secret ABC 
                        projects, but also some well-financed and -trained 
                        terrorist organizations are able to shop in this market. 
                        </kw><br><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">What worries most anti-terrorist experts in 
                        industrialized and democratic nations of the world is 
                        the "marriage of reason" of some "rogue" states and 
                        terrorist organizations, as seen in the case of the 
                        missiles fired by still unidentified terrorists on an 
                        Israeli jetliner on takeoff from Mombassa airport last 
                        November. The missiles, fired from a Russian-made 
                        shoulder-mounted engine, missed the plane that was 
                        carrying 261 passengers. At about the same time, a 
                        suicide car bomb rammed into a hotel in Mombassa, used 
                        by Israeli tourists, killing at least 11 people and 
                        wounding many others. </kw><br><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">At the time, former 
                        Israeli foreign minister Benjamin Netanyahu described 
                        the attack as "a very dangerous escalation of terror". 
                        </kw><br><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">"It means that terror organizations and those 
                        regimes that stand behind them are capable of acquiring 
                        weapons that can bring about mass casualties in every 
                        place in the world," he warned, adding: "Today they 
                        fired missiles at Israeli planes; tomorrow they'll fire 
                        missiles at US planes, British planes, planes from every 
                        state." </kw><br><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">A year before, a Russian airliner full 
                        of Israeli passengers was shot down by a missile over 
                        Ukraine in what was termed an accident. </kw><br><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">Experts 
                        observed that while North Korea has only one land border 
                        with Russia, making it easier for the PSI to control 
                        ships heading for the hermit state, Iran has several 
                        borders with countries that either possess nuclear 
                        technology, such as Pakistan, accused of assisting the 
                        Islamic Republic in its military nuclear-based projects, 
                        or master it, such as some former republics of the 
                        defunct Soviet Union. </kw><br><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">"It is extremely easy to 
                        take spare parts necessary for fabrication of [an] 
                        atomic arsenal in trucks crossing almost all Iran's 
                        neighbors, maybe except for Iraq, which is under US 
                        occupation," one expert told Asia Times Online. 
                        </kw><br><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">According to a report from German intelligence 
                        reported by Taggespiegel, some 70-90 Iranian scientists 
                        are working on Iranian nuclear devices at the nation's 
                        secret sites operated by the Revolutionary Guards. Large 
                        parts of the equipment for both missiles and bombs come 
                        from Pyongyang, via China and Pakistan, where it is 
                        difficult for international agencies to monitor and 
                        control them, Western intelligence sources told Asia 
                        Times Online. </kw><br><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">Tehran is under intense pressure 
                        from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) about 
                        its current nuclear projects, which the United States 
                        and Israel say are ultimately destined for military 
                        purposes, while Iran insists that they are civilian, 
                        aimed primarily at producing electricity, a claim 
                        rejected by Iranian and Western experts on the basis 
                        that Iran possesses huge natural-gas reserves, the 
                        second-largest in the world after Russia's. </kw><br><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">In a 
                        recent report, experts from the Vienna-based IAEA 
                        reported about secret Iranian facilities at the central 
                        city of Natanz for enriching uranium with the help of 
                        centrifuge parts purchased some years ago from probably 
                        China and North Korea as well as on the black markets. 
                        </kw><br><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">The report brought about closer cooperation 
                        between the European Union and Russia, which is 
                        assisting the Islamic Republic in building its first 
                        1,000-megawatt, US$800 million nuclear-powered 
                        electricity plant at the Persian Gulf port of Booshehr. 
                        </kw><br><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">On a recent visit to Tehran, EU Foreign and 
                        Security Affairs Minister Xavier Solana warned Tehran 
                        bluntly that signing the additional protocols to the 
                        Non-Proliferation Treaty was not a bargain for which 
                        Iran could expect rewards. </kw><br><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">"If you don't sign 
                        the protocols, it would be bad news for you," he said of 
                        the conventions that allow IAEA experts to visit all 
                        Iranian atomic-related sites without prior notice and 
                        without preconditions. </kw><br><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">Immediately after the 
                        conclusion of last week's Paris conference, Chinese 
                        Foreign Ministry spokesman Kong Quan told a news 
                        conference in Beijing: "The best way to prevent 
                        proliferation of weapons of mass destruction is through 
                        dialogue. </kw><br><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">"We understand the concerns of some 
                        countries about the proliferation of weapons of mass 
                        destruction ... But many countries still question the 
                        efficiency and legitimacy of adopting this kind of 
                        measure," Kong added. </kw><br><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">China's position on the 
                        PSI plan has been regarded as a determinant of its 
                        success because it controls many of the sea lanes around 
                        the Korean Peninsula, and North Korea uses Chinese air 
                        space to fly shipments to its Middle East trading 
                        partners, mainly Iran, which has been able to build up 
                        advanced medium- and long-range missiles based on North 
                        Korean technology. </kw><br><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">"Finding and presenting the 
                        best ways and means for preventing and stopping 
                        proliferation and dissemination of weapons of mass 
                        destruction and missiles, as well as components and 
                        parts that facilitate their fabrication, is precisely 
                        what the PSI stands for," a French diplomat associated 
                        with the organization of the group's last meeting 
                        explained. </kw><br><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">On a practical level, experts 
                        involved in the Proliferation Security Initiative said 
                        they would seek to make life more difficult for ships 
                        with suspicious cargo by getting permission from coastal 
                        states and countries that issue so-called "flags of 
                        convenience" to authorize at-sea interceptions. 
                        </kw><br><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">The "statement of interdiction principles" 
                        released after the Paris talks contains a commitment to 
                        take action "consistent with national legal authorities 
                        and relevant international law and frameworks, including 
                        the UN Security Council". </kw><br><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">"Certainly there are 
                        always questions about legality over these sorts of 
                        issues. Unfortunately international law isn't as strict 
                        and well defined as we would like it to be," Bolton 
                        observed, adding that it would obviously be better from 
                        the point of view of broader legitimacy to have United 
                        Nations Security Council endorsement of these sorts of 
                        operations. But given the fact that China has a veto on 
                        the Security Council, it is doubtful that anything would 
                        get through of which it didn't approve. 
                        </kw><br><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">Rebuffing concerns that the program could give 
                        the United States and other 10 countries too much power 
                        to stop ships in international waters, Bolton argued 
                        that there is "abundant authority" under existing law to 
                        conduct interdictions, most of which he said take place 
                        in countries' territorial waters. </kw><br><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">In cases where 
                        the legal cover isn't clear, the 11 members of the 
                        Proliferation Security Initiative have committed 
                        themselves to change national and international laws to 
                        strengthen those efforts. </kw><br><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">The statement from the 
                        11 members calls on states seriously to consider 
                        providing consent under the appropriate circumstances to 
                        the boarding and searching of its own flag vessels by 
                        other states. </kw><br><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">A senior US official in Washington 
                        said efforts to recruit new members of the initiative 
                        would begin "relatively soon". The next meeting of the 
                        group will be October 9-10 in London. </kw><br><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">(Copyright
