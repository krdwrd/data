                An analysis of Ordnance Survey maps from the early nineteenth 
                century to date gives a picture of the development of the townland 
                over time. For ease of reference, each parcel of land or forest 
                site will be dealt with separately through an examination of the 
                Ordnance Survey maps. The Down Survey map c.1656 will be dealt 
                with first examining all three sites given the nature of the scale 
                involved and the detail gleaned from this map source. The three 
                forest sites are divided between two 6" Ordnance Survey sheets 
                for county Sligo. Parcel A is located on O.S. sheet 15 while Parcel 
                B and Parcel C are located between sheets 15 and 21 respectively.</kw><br>

                An early account of the parish of Killerry is gained from Samuel 
                Lewis in his Topographical Dictionary of Ireland during his travels 
                in the early nineteenth century:</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
                "Killerry, a parish in the barony of Tirerril, county of 
                Sligo and province of Connaught, four miles south west from Dromahaire 
                on the road from that place to Collooney and on Lough Gill; contains 
                2,969 inhabitants. It comprises 9,135 statute acres, as applotted 
                under the Tithe Act. The land is of good quality, principally 
                under tillage and there is some bog and excellent limestone. Fairs 
                are held at Ballintogher on January 22nd, June 8th, July 28th, 
                October 17th and December 8th; and a manorial court is held there 
                occasionally. Oldcastle, the seat of Earl Loftus Neynoe, Esq., 
                was erected on the site of the old castle of Kingsfort; near it 
                is a strong chalybeate spa. It is a vicarage in the diocese of 
                Ardagh, united to that of Killenumery, the rectory here is impropriate 
                in M. Baker Esq. The tithes amount to £96.18.6, of which 
                one third is payable to the impropriate or, and two thirds to 
                the vicar. The church is a plain building erected in 1715. In 
                the Roman Catholic division it forms part of the district of Killenumery 
                and has a chapel at Ballintobber. About 140 children are educated 
                in two public schools, and 110 children in two private schools. 
                There are some remains of the old church of Killerry with a large 
                burial ground and of an ancient castle at Drumcondra" (Lewis

                "An interesting legend, concerning the little island of Inishfree

                On the islet, though small in size, grow the most lucious of fruit 
                which was however exclusively reserved for the use of the deities, 
                who had placed a great monster or dragon as guard on their orchard. 
                The daughter of the chief of the district required her lover, 
                a young warrior named Free, to procure for her some of the forbidden 
                fruit as proof of his affection and valour. Free landed on the 
                isle, succeeded in slaying the monster placed to guard the trees; 
                but on regaining the frail canoe in which had obtained access 
                to the island, weak and exhausted by his exertions, and feeling 
                need of refreshment, he tasted some of the stolen fruit.</kw></font></p>

                to row to the shore, when he fell dying at the feet of his mistress. 
                He exerted his remaining powers sufficiently to acquaint her with 
                the course of his fate, and the damsel, filled with remorse, immediately 
                herself ate of the stolen fruit, and fell dead across his corpse. 
                The two lovers were buried in the island which had proved so fatal 
                to them. The graves are said to form two ridges.</kw></font></p>

                Cullentra is a large site encompassing over 52 hectares and consists 
                of three separate parcels. The largest of these, Parcel A, includes 
                an oak forest covering the lakeshore (Plate 36) on the peninsula 
                jutting into Lough Gill. No archaeological sites or other structures/remains 
                were located within this parcel. This parcel consists of mature 
                and possibly ancient oak forest (Plate 37) with thick undergrowth 
                (Plate 38). Passage through these areas was very difficult and 
                visibility was low. These woods could potentially yield any number 
                of archaeological sites.</kw></font></p>

                planted with conifers. It is directly opposite the famous Lake 
                Isle of Innisfree (Plate 39). The remains of two vernacular buildings 
                (Plates 40 and 41), clearly marked on the Ordnance Survey maps 
                were located. A circular mound of stones (Plate 42) to the west 
                of the houses was also identified. Mostly mossed over, it consists 
                of loose stones, larger towards the base. It is between 5m and 
                6 metres wide and 1.5m high. The stones at the base do not appear 
                to be earthfast. The mound is quite likely the result of past 
                field clearance. No archaeological sites were identified.</kw></font></p>

                SL021:011/01: Church The church is rectangular in plan incorporated 
                into south wall of a trapezoidal graveyard enclosure. The north 
                wall of the church is 16.20m long and survives to a height of 
                2.60m. The south wall is of similar height but has been incorporated 
                into the enclosure wall of the graveyard. The east gable survives 
                to a height of 5.50m to 6m. It contains a large window (1.60m 
                wide by 2m high) with a low segmental arch. The western and the 
                foundations can still be traced. There are remnants of a low internal 
                dividing wall within the church. This subdivision created a smaller 
                chamber at the west end of the church, 5.20m long east-west. </kw></font></p>

                SL021:011/02: Graveyard The graveyard is trapezoidal in plan and 
                is enclosed by a stone wall 60m east-west on south by 55m north-south 
                at widest side (on east). There is a large table tomb placed centrally 
                within. The graveyard is covered in long grass.</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
                SL021:011/03: Straining Stones They are situated off centre to 
                the north within the graveyard. They consist of a large flat slab 
                which has been broken and the pieces arranged in a semi circle. 
                There are seven rounded stones in all. Two of the round stones 
                partially overlap the flat slab. Also overlying the flat slab 
                is a small angular stone. A small rectangular stone (c.0.30m long) 
                lies adjacent to the slab and has a piece of string tied around 
                it. These stones formed part of a ritual which allegedly cured 
                sprains. The straining stones are fourteenth to eighteenth century 
                in date and are referred to by the church in the Annals of the 
                Four Masters.</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">

                The scale of works planned for this site will involve both clearfelling 
                and planting. Both of these processes are inherently destructive 
                with ground disturbances associated with the use of heavy machinery 
                (for tree removal) and preparation of the land for planting (with 
                the excavation of drainage ditches).</kw></font></p>
              <p><font color="#000000" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif" size="2"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">While 
                the areas to be affected have been surveyed in an attempt at locating 
                and identifying previously unknown archaeological sites, no new 
                sites were revealed. However, it must be borne in mind that archaeological 
                remains with little above ground surface expression may survive 
                below the ground surface. Such features would only be revealed 
                during earthmoving and ground preparation works where such archaeological 
                sites would be directly compromised by these subsequent works.
