of the CPI(M) participated in the land struggle at Ambaripet in Adilabad 
district on August 29, 2007 and ploughed the land occupied by the poor. 
Addressing a meeting organised on the occasion, Raghavulu questioned the 
propriety of the proposal of the government to form an advisory council on the 
land issue to be headed by the chief minister, Y S Rajasekhara Reddy. Pointing 
out that when the chief minister himself had to take measures on the issue, he 
questioned ‘whom would he advise?’ Reiterating the demand of the CPI(M) and the 
Left parties for setting up an independent commission on land issue, Raghavulu 
made it clear once again that the land struggle would continue till then. </kw></font></p>

the CPI(M) and other leaders of the Party, poor people entered into Narne 
estates at Bibinagar in Nalgonda district and put up Red flags. The poor had 
foiled all the efforts made by the police to dissuade them from entering into 
the estates. The police made public announcements threatening the poor people of 
foisting cases against them and sending them to jails, imposed prohibitory 
orders and warned the owners of autos and jeeps not to carry the poor in their 
vehicles and even deployed the police on a large scale. None of these could 
prevent the determined poor from taking part in the land struggle. During the 
first phase of the struggle, the police destroyed overnight about four thousand 
huts erected by the poor in the lands of Narne estates. The police arrested 
Srinivasa Rao, Nandyala Narsimha Reddy, Nalgonda district secretary of CPI(M) 
and B Chandra Reddy and about one hundred poor people and released them later.</kw></font></p>

distances and occupied assigned lands under the illegal occupation of Ramoji 
film city and Sanghi industries on the outskirts of Hyderabad on September 1, 
2007 and put up Red flags. The police were deployed on a large scale and they 
tried to obstruct the rally of the poor to these lands by threatening them and 
arresting some of the leaders and hundreds of the poor on their way to these 
lands. They even tried to mislead the leaders and divert them in order to 
prevent them from reaching the lands. The leaders and the poor reached the lands 
and planted Red flags even on hillocks on the lands. The police arrested

that the government was adopting double standards even in dealing with the land 
struggle. They pointed out that the police, who had not obstructed the leaders 
and the poor when they were planting Red flags in the lands of Ramoji Rao, tried 
to obstruct them when they were going into the lands of Sanghi. They criticised 
the government for trying to suppress the land struggle of the poor, while 
providing protection to thousands of acres of lands encroached by these 
industrialists and media barons. Raghavulu and Narayana questioned the Congress 
leaders, who announced that they would also participate in the land struggle of 
the Left if they came to occupy lands of Ramoji, as to why they had failed to 
participate in the struggle. </kw></font></p>

continued at several areas in the state. Addressing the poor, who occupied land 
at Ameenpur in Medak district, V Srinivasa Rao lashed out at the chief minister 
for trying to ridicule the struggles of the poor, while he himself participated, 
along with the Left parties, in the movement against hike in power tariff when 
he was in the opposition. The police arrested about 300 people led by KVPS

Hills in Hyderabad. Led by Nomula Narsimhaiah, the poor occupied ceiling lands
