<h1><a href="http://www.collegeart.org/guidelines/"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-2">Guidelines</kw></a></h1>
<h2><kw class="krdwrd-tag-2">M.F.A. Standards</kw></h2><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">
Adopted by CAA Board of Directors, April 16, 1977; revised October 12, 1991. </kw><br>
<br>
<strong><kw class="krdwrd-tag-2">DEFINITION AND PURPOSE</kw></strong><br>
<br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
The M.F.A., unlike most master's degrees, is used as a </kw><em><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">guarantee</kw></em><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3"> of a 
high level of professional competence in the visual arts. It is also accepted 
as an indication that the recipient has reached the end of the </kw><em><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">formal</kw></em><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3"> 
aspects of his/her education in the making of art, that is to say, it is the terminal 
degree in visual arts education and thus equivalent to terminal degrees in other 
fields, such as the Ph.D. or Ed.D.</kw><br>
<br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
First and foremost, the profession demands from the recipient of the M.F.A. a 
certifiable level of technical proficiency and the ability to make art. However, 
having earned the degree does not necessarily guarantee an ability to teach this 
proficiency to others. When work toward the M.F.A. has been concentrated in a 
particular medium, there should be complete professional mastery of that medium. 
The generalist, whose preparation has been broader and less specialized, must 
still meet the critical demands of the profession by convincingly demonstrating 
expertise and knowledge in a number of areas. The need for thorough training of 
the mind, the eye, and the hand is self-evident. The remainder of this document 
outlines specific standards and requirements for the M.F.A. that are approved 
and endorsed by the CAA Board of Directors.</kw><br>
<strong><kw class="krdwrd-tag-2">DEGREE REQUIREMENTS</kw></strong> 
<h4><kw class="krdwrd-tag-2">Definition of Credit</kw></h4>
<blockquote><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">Because credits are a unit of measure, reflecting amounts of work 
  over certain periods of time, a precise definition is needed in order to reconcile 
  the differing academic record-keeping arrangements that exist throughout the 
  nation. The College Art Association recognizes a standard in which one semester 
  credit represents three hours of work per week over a semester of at least fifteen 
  weeks (one-quarter credit is the equivalent of 66 percent of a semester credit). 
  Work toward credit may take place in formal classes, critiques, and technical 
  workshops, or may be independent studio activity. While the distribution of 
  time spent between formal and independent options is a decision that must be 
  made by the faculty, who determine specific educational patterns within a given 
  institution and a given discipline, the ratio of three hours of work per credit 
  must be met.</kw></blockquote>
<h4><kw class="krdwrd-tag-2">Credit Requirements</kw></h4>
<blockquote><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">The minimum requirement for the M.F.A. is 60 semester credits of course 
  work at the graduate level (or 90 quarter credits), including courses in art 
  history and cognate areas of study. These required credits may not include course 
  work that is required as make-up for undergraduate deficiencies.</kw><br>
  <br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
  Undergraduate degrees (B.A., B.F.A., B.S., B.Ed.) differ in disciplinary credit 
  distribution and educational emphasis. In order to compensate for these differences 
  in the studies (both undergraduate and graduate) leading ultimately to the M.F.A. 
  degree, the following combined (undergraduate </kw><em><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">plus</kw></em><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3"> graduate) semester 
  credit totals are recommended: art studio, 100; history of art, 24. However, 
  new genres/disciplines in the visual arts at the graduate level may require 
  or take into consideration undergraduate study outside traditional art studio 
  areas (video and computer-based art, for example). Thus the total semester credit 
  hours recommended for the undergraduate/graduate program leading to the M.F.A. 
  in studio art may have to be adjusted to include appropriate course work relevant 
  to new genres of studio practice. The above recommendations are not absolute 
  minimum requirements, but provide reasonable guidelines for faculties concerned 
  with maintaining the standards of the profession. </kw><br>
  <br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
  In addition to the required number of credits, which are essential, the M.F.A. 
  as a terminal degree demands a level of maturity that can develop only from 
  study over an extended period of time. It is strongly recommended that there 
  be a balance between classes with scheduled meetings and those that are supervisory; 
  the practice of basing the M.F.A. entirely on supervisory courses and individual 
  critiques must be discouraged, as this format does not lend itself to sustained 
  intellectual, artistic, and theoretical exchange. Moreover, CAA strongly recommends 
  that two years of study for the degree be considered an absolute minimum, with 
  three years preferable and advisable. </kw></blockquote>
<h4><kw class="krdwrd-tag-2">Studio Curriculum</kw></h4>
<blockquote><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">It is not the intention of CAA to provide curriculum outlines and 
  thus undermine the valid principle of diversity in higher education. Credit 
  distribution must be left to individual programs in the belief that they will 
  capitalize on their strengths and minimize their weaknesses in order to provide 
  the most sound education possible. At the same time, there are certain requirements 
  and standards that should be considered in every program of study. </kw><br>
  <br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
  Graduate faculties have the responsibility of structuring courses and course 
  sequences in studio disciplines to lead to the achievement of professional competence. 
  This goal may be met through concentration in any one specific discipline (painting, 
  sculpture, performance, ceramics, video, etc.) and/or by intelligently designed 
  interdisciplinary programs of study. For the latter, it should be stressed that 
  the range of diversity must, of necessity, be limited in order to guarantee 
  the depth of involvement demanded by graduate standards in each discipline. 
  Each student deserves from the staff careful consideration of individual needs 
  and conscientious direction in planning an appropriate course of study. </kw></blockquote>
<h4><kw class="krdwrd-tag-2">Requirements in Art History, Art Criticism, and Other Cognate Areas </kw></h4>
<blockquote><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">Much of a practicing artist's knowledge of our cultural heritage is 
  gained through studying art history. Accordingly, formal courses in art history 
  are considered essential to an M.F.A. program (CAA recommends a minimum combined 
  undergraduate and graduate total of 24 semester credits). For M.F.A. candidates, 
  advanced courses on various historical periods, styles, and themes are strongly 
  recommended. To encourage greater diversity among students seeking the professional 
  degree, requirements should include options stressing the history and role of 
  the visual arts in cultures other than those of Western Europe and North American. 
  (Statistics compiled by the National Association of Schools of Art and Design 
  indicate that the number of students of color completing the M.F.A. degree remains 
  disproportionately low.) Seminars in modern and contemporary art history, theory, 
  and criticism are especially appropriate for M.F.A. candidates. Art criticism, 
  which develops from art history and in some respects cannot be separated from 
  it, is another crucial part of the informed artist's education. Self-criticism 
  and external comparison are among the means by which artists evaluate their 
  ideas, processes, and/or the objects they make; these skills cannot be left 
  entirely to intuition or casually grasped assumptions. A large part of criticism 
  of self and others is verbal (in many cases, a major component of a work of 
  art may be verbal); therefore, verbal skills must not be ignored. The need for 
  continual writing, criticism, and self-explication in the careers of most artists 
  is self-evident. </kw><br>
  <br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
  Other disciplines of educational value to the student should also be encouraged 
  where relevant, and may in some cases replace art history, theory, and/or criticism 
  courses. In addition to helping students design their programs of study, the 
  faculty must consider all of their individual needs and advise M.F.A. candidates 
  to take full advantage of appropriate resources in areas both in and outside 
  the visual arts that are available in the M.F.A. granting institution, guiding 
  them to learning in such cognate areas as will augment the total educational 
  experience. </kw></blockquote>
<h4><kw class="krdwrd-tag-2">Theses and Comprehensive Examinations </kw></h4>
<blockquote><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">A written thesis on art history or theory should not necessarily be 
  required; however, a critical statement, in writing, on the student's work, 
  its development, and its cultural and historical references should be insisted 
  on as a logical alternative. </kw><br>
  <br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
  Comprehensive, out-of-class art history examinations, whether oral or written, 
  should not be required. High-quality performance in course work itself can be 
  counted on as assurance of the student's having a good working knowledge of 
  the material. </kw></blockquote>
<h4><kw class="krdwrd-tag-2">Graduate Exhibition </kw></h4>
<blockquote><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">As a final step prior to receiving the degree, each M.F.A. candidate 
  should be required to mount a substantial exhibition of his/her work. Some schools 
  face a difficult problem of providing satisfactory spaces for individual exhibitions, 
  which should be solved by finding large facilities for group shows, either on 
  or off campus. Even when space considerations necessitate group exhibitions, 
  however, every care must be taken to insure that individual students are able 
  to place a sufficient number of works together for viewers to assess their development. 
  This is particularly important in contexts in which the M.F.A. exhibition serves 
  as an introduction of the student's work to a larger professional art community. 
  Since the profession demands from M.F.A. degree recipients an ability "to make 
  art," a faculty, institutional, and public review of the final product is absolutely 
  necessary. </kw></blockquote>
<h4><kw class="krdwrd-tag-2">Slide Portfolio and Retention of Student Work </kw></h4>
<blockquote><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">A slide portfolio of the M.F.A. exhibition should be required and 
  kept by the school for the record. In addition, institutional resources should, 
  if possible, be used to purchase one or more examples of work for the school's 
  permanent collection. CAA, in its resolution of April 29, 1972, has discouraged 
  the all-too-prevalent past practice of institutions </kw><strong><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">demanding,</kw></strong><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3"> 
  without compensation, examples of student work. The acquisition of student work 
  assumes the existence of adequate display and/or storage facilities for artwork. 
</kw></blockquote>
<strong><kw class="krdwrd-tag-2">ADMISSIONS</kw></strong> 
<h4><kw class="krdwrd-tag-2">Preadmission Preparation and Dealing with Deficiencies </kw></h4>
<blockquote><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">Admission to M.F.A. programs should be based on the nature, extent, 
  and quality of undergraduate preparation, including courses in studio art, art 
  history, and other academic subjects. Quality of studio preparation can best 
  be judged on the basis of careful evaluation of work done at the undergraduate 
  level; therefore, a portfolio review is regarded as an absolute necessity in 
  the admissions process. </kw><br>
  <br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
  While many institutions consider the B.F.A. to be the standard qualifying degree, 
  the fact that the applicant has attended a B.A. or B.S.-granting institution 
  does not necessarily rule out acceptance in most M.F.A. programs. Whatever the 
  undergraduate degree, most entering graduate students tend not to be completely 
  prepared in one or more of the areas cited above and will require remedial work.

  <br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
  Prior to the admission of a successful applicant, the graduate faculty should 
  determine the individual's deficiencies in studio art, art history, and general 
  studies and inform the student of its findings. The prospective student should 
  also be given a clear indication of the prerequisite make-up the institution 
  will require, emphasizing that no course work to compensate for gaps in undergraduate 
  preparation can be counted as contributing to the minimum number of credits 
  required for the M.F.A. degree. </kw></blockquote>
<h4><kw class="krdwrd-tag-2">Advising on Degree Requirements </kw></h4>
<blockquote><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">Admission committees are urged to clearly inform each potential student 
  of the institution's M.F.A. requirements and other relevant matters concerning 
  the specific make-up of the degree program, pointing out the various guidelines 
  previously outlined in this document, including the minimum of 60 graduate credits, 
  and other curricular requirements. </kw></blockquote>
<h4><kw class="krdwrd-tag-2">The M.A. as a Qualifying Prerequisite </kw></h4>
<blockquote><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">Some institutions use the M.A. degree (30 credits) as a qualifying 
  prerequisite for final acceptance into M.F.A. candidacy, allowing the student 
  to apply the earned credits toward the higher degree. This practice is legitimate 
  only if the quality of work toward the M.A. is acceptable within the terminal 
  degree standards, and if total degree requirements are ultimately met. </kw></blockquote>
<strong><kw class="krdwrd-tag-2">GRADUATE FACULTY</kw></strong><br>
<blockquote><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">It is axiomatic that M.F.A. programs should have excellent and well-qualified 
  teachers. While quality of teaching is of primary importance, professional recognition 
  of individual faculty members is also desirable. Not every good teacher needs 
  to be a recognized star, but CAA is concerned that all graduate faculty members 
  be fully competent professionally and that they be professionally active in 
  their respective disciplines and fields. This standard does not necessarily 
  imply the imposition of age and experience standards. Some very young artist/teachers 
  are as well qualified as many faculty members who have taught for a number of 
  years. Each individual must be judged on his/her own strengths and weaknesses. 
  </kw><br>
  <br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
  A faculty needs to be large enough so that students can receive the amount of 
  instruction they deserve, and diverse enough in its areas of expertise to cover 
  thoroughly all fields offered. It is not necessary for every institution to 
  offer everything; however, the disciplines that it does and does not offer should 
  be made clear to all applicants. To guarantee graduate programs of quality, 
  it is of critical importance that schools or university departments offer fields 
  of study only when excellent instructional resources are available in a specific 
  discipline or within an interdisciplinary range. </kw><br>
  <br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
  Visiting artists and visiting lecturers can provide inspiration and broadened 
  horizons for any student body (and faculty), multiplying diversity of intellectual, 
  aesthetic, and cultural points of view, from which all can benefit. Full value 
  from such outside authorities, however, usually demands more extended contact 
  than that afforded by a one-hour lecture, which can leave students with only 
  fragmentary, superficial impressions of what they have heard and seen. Visits 
  of several days duration are recommended. It is also important that affirmative 
  action goals not be solely addressed through visiting artist programs; rather, 
  permanent faculties should reflect not only gender but also other demographic 
  patterns. </kw></blockquote>
<strong><kw class="krdwrd-tag-2">FACILITIES</kw></strong><br>
<blockquote><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">M.F.A. programs should be offered only in those areas that are fully 
  and adequately equipped with a reasonably full range of available technology 
  and satisfactory working spaces for the students. While facilities can never 
  take the place of gifted teachers and students, the better they are, the more 
  those using them will benefit. Specialized equipment is absolutely necessary 
  in some areas, and students should not only become technically competent in 
  its use, but should also understand fully safe shop and studio practices and 
  procedures. </kw><br>
  <br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
  Private studios for graduate students are a near necessity, though they should 
  not be so private--so segregated--that they prevent healthy contact and interchange. 
  Independent studios should be supplemented by readily available access to all 
  shops, labs, and general studios. In institutions that do not provide private 
  studios for graduate students, students must have access to a private communal 
  space set aside for their specific needs as a community. </kw><br>
  <br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
  No M.F.A. program can exist without adequate library, museum, and exhibition 
  resources. The need for access to the library at all hours, within reason, is 
  clear. M.F.A. students must have reasonable access to the visual cultures of 
  the past and have continuous contact with the works of the present. </kw></blockquote>
<strong><kw class="krdwrd-tag-2">FINANCIAL SUPPORT</kw></strong><br>
<blockquote><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3"> It is not appropriate, within the limits of this document, to deal 
  at length with the important subject of graduate assistantships and other forms 
  of financial assistance. At the same time, CAA wishes to enunciate two principles 
  that have direct bearing on the question of standards in M.F.A. programs:</kw><br>
  <br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
  1. No graduate academic credit should be given for teaching or other assistantship 
  work for which pay is received.</kw><br>
  <br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
  2. When graduate faculties distribute assistantship assignments, they must consider 
  with care the hours each week needed by their students to complete the academic 
  obligations expected of them. The foregoing requirements and guidelines define 
  clearly the amount of time and commitment necessary to justify the granting 
  of the M.F.A. Undue interference with the right of students to apply themselves 
  to their primary mission in graduate school is both unfair and unwise. </kw></blockquote>
