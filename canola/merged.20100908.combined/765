Although some people might be surprised to learn that there are still pirates living in the
Caribbean, the fact is, they never went away but instead slowly became assimilated into society
like a glass of red wine spilled onto your living room carpet. Many went into the real estate
business: "Aarrgghh, 'tis a fine piece of beachfront property and a bargain at only $3 million.
Don't worry about the high water. It's just one of those freak spring tides aggravated by El Nino.
It only happens every score years or so. How lucky ye were to see it; now ye know exactly where to
build the house." 
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">Capt. Heel was a pirate all right; if the hook on his arm didn't give it away, then the eye
patch and tricorn hat were a dead giveaway - long before you noticed the crusted parrot poop on the
shoulder of his puffy shirt (he did give his incontinent parrot, Satan, fair warning that if it
happened again, it would be keelhauled). Instead of going into real estate, Capt. Heel chose to
become a charter boat captain, plundering fish in the sea, not to mention into the wallets of
tourists not savvy enough to know his hidden fees were as bogus as the safety inspection sticker
and licenses on his boat, the Fairly Jolly Roger: "Aye matey, that's a lovely wahoo you just
caught, but as I'm sure you know, the $300 cruising permit (a real Bahamian tax, no doubt thought
up by another pirate) doesn't include the $30 'wahoo stamp' that you need to keep her. Technically,
you're supposed to get it before we shove off, but if ye won't tell anyone, neither will I.
Haaarrrrr!"

than his usual surcharge-fueled bonanza, but what he didn't know was that the client he was taking
out was about to give him a lesson in the fine art of "gotcha" - this man was a fishing
sportswriter. 
</kw><br> 
<br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">"Good morning Capt. Heel, the name's Davy Insano, and this is your lucky day. I'm doing a
feature story for Hook, Line and Sinker magazine on famous charter boat captains, and I've selected
you to be the star of my article. But before we shove off, would you like to have lunch with me at
the tiki bar?" 
</kw><br> 
<br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">"Gaaarrr... I don't know what happened to the gent who was supposed to pay the check. He said
he just had to use the head and never came back. Aye, never ye mind, I'll just pay it and add it to
his charter fee. Shiver me timbers, would you look at this tab: a triple order of conch fritters
for starters, four fish sandwiches, six Red Stripes and a double Bushmills. He's no man; he's a
remorseless, consuming machine!" 
</kw><br> 
<br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">"Hi, Captain. I'm sorry that I missed you back at the restaurant, but I noticed that the
light was perfect for photographing your boat. Shall we move onward and shove off?" 
</kw><br> 
<br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">"Aye lad, 'tis a fine tuna ye've caught, but as I'm sure ye know, your $150 fishing license
(another real fee) doesn't cover the cost of your $50 'tuna stamp.' What's this piece of paper
you're handing me? It's a letter from the Department of Fisheries saying to waive any fishing fees
in conjunction with your story." 
</kw><br> 
<br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">"Captain, that was a fantastic day of fishing, I don't know when I've caught more fish. I'm
sure my readers are going to enjoy the story; you really know your stuff." 
</kw><br> 
<br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">"Thank ye matey, now there's just the little matter of my charter fee. Let's see, with the
bait surcharge, hook replacement fee and gaff tax, that comes to $1,250, not including the tip.
What's this piece of paper ye are handing me now? From the Minister of Tourism, saying to bill them
for any charter fees relating to your story?" 
</kw><br> 
<br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">"Yes, the Minister of Fisheries says that any captain with a valid license will be fully
reimbursed. Your license is valid, isn't it? Captain, are you OK? You don't look so good." 
</kw><br> 
<br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">"AAAAARRRRRRRGGGGGG!"
