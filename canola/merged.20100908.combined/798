<hr size="3" width="100%" noshade="noshade">
<br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">1. The first step taken in planning their escape: Xodar draws a map
of Omean and the shortest route to Helium.
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">2. . . . Second step: Xodar explains the duties and customs of the
Shador guards.
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">3. Purpose of Carter's leaps to the high barred windows: To look for
a small craft moored near the island.
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">4. Reason for Carter's leaping over the partition to the next cell:
So the visiting guard would not see him and learn of his ability to leap
to the window.
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">5. Reason for the guard's surprise after he completed his search: The
missing Carter has suddenly returned.
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">6. Why Carter was so curious about the Martian boy: Everything about
him is very familiar.
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">7. Why Carter and the boy were led to great amphitheatre: To participate
in the monthly rites of Issus.
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">8. Why the black men participated in the rites: To wash the sins from
their souls and to prove their loyalty to Issus.
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">9. Prize to the outsiders who won: They get to fight again.
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">10. What Carter saw across the arena from his cage: The horrid Issus
sitting in splendour and surrounded by her 100 slave maidens, and many
soldiers and dignitaries.
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">11. People who do all the work in First Born society: Slaves.
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">12. Fate of Issus' slaves at the end of one year of service: Butchered
for Issus' dining table or killed in the arena by Great White Apes.
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">13. Leaders of the slave revolt in the arena: Carter and the young
red Martian.
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">14. The surprising ability of the young man: He can leap and fight
nearly as well as Carter.
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">15. Carter's strategy when the First Born forces became too great:
He leads an attack to reach Issus.
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">16. Meaning of the cry, "Rise slaves!": The female slaves are attacking
their masters.
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">17. Two people who saved Carter's life: The red Martian youth and Phaidor.
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">18. Phaidor's plea to Carter: For him to leave the arena and strive
to reach her father, Matai Shang to find a way to rescue her.
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">19. Issus' means of escape: A dark opening in the flooring of the dais.
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">20. Why Carter must now meet the mob alone: The slaves have all been
killed and the lad has been knocked unconscious.

<hr size="3" width="100%" noshade="noshade">
<br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">1. How Carter and the lad escaped the mob: They fall into the chute
through which Issus has escaped.
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">2. Sight in the apartment at the bottom of the chute: A cursing Issus
behind the safety of a barred gate.
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">3. Vital knowledge possessed by the lad: He had labored as a slave
remodeling this area and knows of a vast network of concealed corridors
beneath this chamber.
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">4. The explanation for the origin of the red race: In the ancient fight
for survival against dwindling resources and the savage green men, the
three main races of black, white and yellow men had amalgamated, resulting
in the red race.
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">5. Where their escape through the pits of Issus led: The submarine
pool.
</kw><br><font color="#3333ff"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">6. Reason the submarine was deserted: a radio-aerial
message has ordered everyone to the arena to put down the slave revolt.</kw></font>
<br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">7. Reason for their return to Shador prison: to free Xodar
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">8. Purpose of the phony dispatch written by Carter: To have the guards
escort them back to their cells.
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">9. How Carter convinced the boy that their return to prison was a wise
plan: Later they can easily escape and find weapons.
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">10. Carter's situation at chapter's end: Back in the cell with Xodar
as prisoner of the the First Born.
</kw><p>

<hr size="3" width="100%" noshade="noshade">
<br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">1. Carter's escape plan: He will help the lad and Xodar escape the
cell and they will swim to an airship docked nearby.
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">2. Xodar's realization about Carter and the lad: "One might think you
two master and pupil, or father and son." He notes the resemblance between
them in appearance and fighting styles.
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">3. Issus' method of delivering to the therns her decrees that are written
in blood upon parchment: Messengers travel through a long tunnel from the
temple of Issus to Matai Shang's temple.
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">4. Population control for the First Born who are thought to live forever:
The men die through combat and the women are removed when their men tire
of them and bring in someone new.
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">5. Reason why Martians from the outside do not live beyond 1000: At
that age tradition dictates that they make their voluntary pilgrimage down
the River Iss.
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">6. Why they decided to use Xodar's private ship: It is nearby, holds
five and is geared for speed.
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">7. What made the lad's escape easier: He, like Carter, can jump to
great heights.
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">8. Reason for their wait at the top of the jail structure: They wait
for the sentry to pass before descending to the ground.
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">9. Carter's actions while his companions waited in the water: He retrieves
weapons from the guard house.
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">10. Fate of the guard who discovered Carter in the guardhouse: He is
shot.
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">11. Burdens carried by the swimmers: Carter carries three swords and
Xodar carries the Martian boy.
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">12. The problem they faced when they reached the ship: The sentry on
the nearby battleship detects them and fires an alarm gun.
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">13. Carter's strategy when a cruiser blocked their way to the mouth
of the shaft: He rams the ship's keel, sending ship and crew into the sea.
</kw><br><font color="#3333ff"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">14. Carter's method of rising through the shaft
faster than the pursuing ships with larger buoyancy tanks: He points the
prow of the ship upward and flies straight up under full power.</kw></font>
<br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">15. Reference point that Carter used to guide the ship through the
unlighted shaft: The circle of light from the shaft entrance below.
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">16. Speed at which Carter's flier travelled through the two-mile-long
vertical shaft: 200 mph
</kw><br><font color="#3333ff"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">17. Reason for no visible stars or moons in the
sky: It is summer at the south pole at which time the melting ice cap creates
clouds -- a meteoric phenomenon seldom seen elsewhere on Mars.</kw></font>
<br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">18. Carter's strategy for losing his pursuers: He flies through the
clouds then rises above them.
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">19. What they have accomplished that never has been done: They have
escaped from the land of the First Born.
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">20. Revelation at chapter's end: The red Martian boy is John Carter's
son.

<hr size="3" width="100%" noshade="noshade">
<br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">1. Carter's first words to his son: "Tell me of your mother"
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">2. Event held each year on the anniversary of Carter's disappearance:
A great festival honouring him as the saviour of the planet.
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">3. Meaning of the boy's name of Carthoris: Chosen by his parents before
his birth -- a combination of their two names.
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">4. Problem with the ship: One of the forward ray tanks was ruptured
when they rammed the cruiser.
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">5. Expected result of the damage: The craft will soon be helpless in
the air.
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">6. Main occupants of the ancient cities that dotted the Martian landscape
below: The great white apes
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">7. Event corresponding with the sunrise: The ship becomes unmanageable
and they have to abandon the derelict craft.
</kw><br><font color="#3333ff"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">8. The first sustenance of the day: Huge "milk"-giving
shrubs, a green Martian food staple.</kw></font>
<br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">9. Where Thuvia found Carter and his companions at mid-afternoon: Sleeping
under the milk shrubs.
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">10. Why Thuvia and Tars Tarkas abandoned their flier: They did not
know how to control it and decided to carry on to Helium by foot.
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">11. Tars Tarkas' attackers in the abandoned city: Warhoons
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">12. What Thuvia observed from her hiding place: After an hour-long
battle Tars Tarkas was overwhelmed and carried off severely wounded.
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">13. Carter's plan for that night: To enter the Warhoon city alone to
find Tars Tarkas.
</kw><br><font color="#3333ff"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">14. Where the Warhoon thoats and zitidars grazed:
In city court yard on the moss-like ocher vegetation that overgrows most
of Mars</kw></font>
<br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">15. Carter's means of entry into the main building in city centre:
He leaps to second floor balcony and enters an unlit corridor.
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">16. How Carter found Tars Tarkas: He follows the guards to the pits
below the building where the Thark is chained.
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">17. Why Carter was unable to follow Tars Tarkas and his captors: He
becomes lost in the maze of dark corridors.
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">18. What Carter could see of his attackers in the Stygian darkness
of the pits: Only 4 pair of eyes.
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">19. Where Carter had come in contact with a beast like this 20 years
before: While a prisoner in the Warhoon dungeons.
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">20. Carter's predicament at chapter's end: A creature leaps onto his
back and something cold, moist and slimy fastens on his throat.

harness he poses as one of his guards, Tan Gama.
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">3. Escape route taken by Carter and the Thark: They retrace the route

mounted on two tharks and herding three more.
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">13. Reason for the non-stop northward race of Carter's party: A great
body of pursuing green warriors.
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">14. The calamity that slowed them down before they could reach the
hills: Thuvia must share Carter's mount after her thoat collapses from
exhaustion.
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">15. Thuvia's sacrifice: She slips off Carter's thoat so that he will
have a better chance of escaping.
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">16. Party's response to Thuvia's actions: They join Carter and send
her on alone while they prepare to battle the oncoming green horde.
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">17. Reason for the sudden death of 100 of the Warhoons: A shell burst
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">18. The effect upon the other Warhoons: They retreat in panic.

<br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">1. The welcome sight in the sky: A fleet of ships of the Helium navy.
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">2. Circumstance that tempered the jubilation over the return of Carter
and Carthoris: That they have returned from the Valley Dor ~ a forbidden
act.
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">3. Significance of swords being thrown at Carter's feet: An oath of
fealty normally paid only to a great Jeddak
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">4. Reason for sending out a search party: To find Thuvia who Carthoris
had sent off on a thoat to escape the Warhoon attack.
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">5. The commander of the ship </kw><i><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">Xavarian</kw></i><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1"> to which Carter was taken:
Carter's old friend Kantos Kan
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">6. Why Carter was not queried as to where he has been for 10 years:
Everyone fears that he has returned from the Valley Dor which would be
his death sentence.
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">7. Reason for Dejah Thoris' grief: Loss of Carter followed by the loss
of Carthoris . . . and possibly her father and grandfather.
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">8. News of Mors Kajak and Tardos Mors: Rumoured dead after leading
a search expedition across the northern hemisphere.

Zodanga (appointed to the position after Carter refused the honour following
Zodanga's defeat by the green hordes and Helium forces)
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">10. Surmised explanation for Dejah Thoris' disappearance: The Princess,
Sola and a dozen servants have probably left to take the pilgrimage down
the River Iss.
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">11. Result of the search for Thuvia: Unsuccessful
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">12. Orders brought by a flier from Zat Arrras on the fleet's flagship:
To bring "the prisoners" before him.
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">13. Zat Arrras' newly conferred authority: Following the loss of Helium
leaders he is highest in command in the government of Helium.
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">14. Zat Arrras' breach of good taste and chivalry: He should have come
to greet Carter with honours due the saviour of Barsoom.
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">15. Carter's response to Zat Arrras' charges of blasphemy: He attacks
and starts to choke him.
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">16. Reason for Carter's retreat: Kantos Kan reminds him of the consequences
which would lead to revolution.
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">17. Effect upon Zat Arrras: No one has come to his defence and he stands
white, trembling and the object of scorn among his officers.
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">18. What devout followers of age-old religious superstition felt must
be Carter's fate: A terrible death, as he is a fugitive from the Valley
Dor and a lying heretic.
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">19. Carter's concern that over rode his own possible fate: That Dejah
Thoris has taken the pilgrimage on the River Iss.
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">20. Most prominent building in greater Helium: The mile-high scarlet
tower.
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">21. Helium building to which the Carter party were escorted: Temple

<br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">1. What Carter saw at the end of the temple's Aisle of Hope: The 31
"impartial" judges are all unfriendly Zodangans.

which contains the Pedestal of Truth.
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">3. The presiding magistrate: Zat Arrras.
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">4. Man who came to Carter's defence after the judge's call for death:
Kantos Kan.
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">5. Result of the audience's shouts for justice: Carter is allowed to
make a two-hour appeal to the men of Helium in his own defence.
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">6. Reaction of the audience to the judges' demand for the death penalty:
They crowd around Carter and throw their swords at his feet and rally to
his defence.
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">7. Carter's reason for asking for a delay in the conclusion of the
trial for a year or until the return of Tardos Mors or Mors Kajak: To avert
a civil war in Helium.
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">8. Place to which Carter was escorted: The royal palace.
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">9. Reaction of the crowds along the way: Outpourings of love and allegiance

grief.

<hr size="3" width="100%" noshade="noshade">
<br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">1. Dejah Thoris' actions seven days earlier after her meeting with
Zat Arrras: She slipped out of the palace with Woola to travel south to
the River Iss.
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">2. Sola's reaction: She gathered together 12 guards and they caught
up with her
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">3. Fate of the pilgrimage party: Attacked by warriors from a black
pirate fleet -- only Dejah Thoris and Sola survived to be taken prisoner.
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">4. Identity of another red woman prisoner the pirates had recently
captured: Thuvia
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">5. The mission of the black pirate's air fleet: To recapture a party
of fugitives who had escaped several days earlier.
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">6. Dejah Thoris' reason for cursing Zat Arrras after hearing Thuvia's
story: Because of him she had left Helium while Carter and Carthoris still
lived.
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">7. Details of Sola's escape: She was of no use to the pirates who shoved
her off the ship -- she landed on soft moss at the top of a high hill and
survived her fall.
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">8. Why the predicted six months to prepare an invasion fleet was not
of great concern: Dejah Thoris and Thuvia would most certainly be chosen
by Issus to serve a year's term as her slaves.
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">9. Why they believed that mission wouldn't be opposed by Zat Arrras:
Carter's departure will bring him closer to assuming the title of Jeddak.
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">10. Hor Vastus' whispered plan to thwart Zat Arrras: "John Carter,
Jeddak of Helium."
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">11. Unwelcome visitor: One of Zat Arrras' spies eavesdropping on their
plans.
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">12. Why Zat Arrras probably would not welcome the return of Dejah Thoris:
She would stand between him and the throne.
</kw><br><font color="#3333ff"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">13. Person in charge of refitting the rescue
ships with water propellers in Hastor: Xodar who had done this many times.</kw></font>
<br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">14. Tars Tarkas' part in the rescue plan: To try to assemble the green
hordes to be transported to the Valley Dor and Temple of Issus.
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">15. Zat Arrras' act of treachery:&nbsp; Carter's kidnapping ~ he orders
a team of kidnappers to capture Carter while asleep and carry him out of
the palace through the maze of corridors in the subterranean pits.

<hr size="3" width="100%" noshade="noshade">
<br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">1. Zat Arrras' conditions for Carter's release: That none of the royal
family are ever to return to Helium and that he be made Jeddak.
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">2. Probable result of Carter's refusal to enter this dishonourable
alliance: Death of Carter and Dejah Thoris. . . with honour.
</kw><br><font color="#3333ff"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">3. What the guards' radium hand-light revealed
in Carter's dungeon in the pits: human skeletons chained to the walls.</kw></font>
<br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">4. Carter's only respite from darkness and silence for the next 330
days: Twice daily visits from a guard bringing prison food and Zat Arrras'
orders that he accept his ultimatum.
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">5. Reason for Carter's offer to reward Parthak, his guard, with some
of his personal trappings and weapons: To get a message to Carthoris indicating
that he still lives.
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">6. Result of Carter's deal with his prison guard: The guard is replaced.
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">7. Carter's surprise after his desperate attack on his jailer: The
man is actually Carthoris.
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">8. Parthak's fate when he wouldn't reveal information about Carter
to Carthoris: He was chained in a dungeon until he talked.
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">9. Hor Vastus' reason for posing as an imprisoned Zodangan soldier
in Parthak's cell: To pry information from him.
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">10. Reason the rescue fleet had not yet left for the Land of the First
Born: Because they had to work in secret the preparations took much longer
than planned.
</kw><br><font color="#3333ff"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">11. What was prepared to leave Hastor that tonight:
1,000 mighty battleships, each fitted with water propellers and a small
fleet of cruisers and scouts.</kw></font>
<br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">12. What was the nature of the fleet assembled at Thark: many hundreds
of large troop ships to carry 250,000 green warriors from every part of
Barsoom.
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">13. Size of Hor Vastus' force of red men from Helium's districts: One
million warriors vowed to secrecy.
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">14. Identity of the spy the guards had killed: A Holy Thern disguised
with red skin die and a black wig.
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">15. Reason for the sudden haste in launching the attack: The escape
of a Holy Thern spy and the discovery that half the gate guards were therns
in disguise.

<hr size="3" width="100%" noshade="noshade">
<br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">1. Reason why it was too late to save Dejah Thoris: 365 days - a year
-- have passed.
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">2. What Carter now hoped to gain from the attack: Revenge and a means
of proving that their religion is false which will save countless lives
in the future.
</kw><br><font color="#3333ff"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">3. How might the farmers of Barsoom benefit:
The Valley Dor and Land of Lost Souls have vast supplies of water and rich
farmland that needs no irrigation.</kw></font>
<br><font color="#3333ff"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">4. Reason that radio-aerograms were not often
used for important messages: W</kw><b><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">ireless communication is not secure and
can be easily intercepted despite having tried every known wave length</kw></b></font>
<br><font color="#3333ff"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">5. Type of craft encircling the main fleet of
battleships and transports: one-man air scouts.</kw></font>
<br><font color="#3333ff"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">6. Nature of the opposing force from the south-south-east:
a fleet of thousands of battleships.</kw></font>
<br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">7. Mission of the ten battleships sent to the entrance to Omean: To
let no hostile vessel enter or leave the shaft, thus bottling up the great
fleet of the First Born.
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">8. Formation taken by Carter's main fleet: Battleships in a V pointing
south-south-east with the transports and their convoys behind.
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">9. Destination of the troop transports: The temples and gardens of
the therns.
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">10. Position taken by the Helium fleet after the first breakthrough
encounter: They encircle the enemy fleet moving at high speed to make them
difficult targets.
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">11. Commander of another attacking fleet of 5,000 ships:&nbsp; The
treacherous Zat Arrras, "Jeddak of Helium" who sends a message by radio-aerogram
ordering Carter's fleet to surrender.
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">12. Effect upon the retreating thern fleet who intercepted the Zat
Arrras' message: They resume the battle.
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">13. Identity of a third attacking fleet: The fleet of the First Born
who had started leaving the Omean entrance shaft before the ten Helium
guard ships had arrived.
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">14. Response of the Heliumetic crewmen in Zat Arrras' fleet when they
saw the colours of the Prince of Helium unfurled: they change allegiances
and break out the colors of the Prince of Helium.
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">15. Fate of Zat Arrras after Carter led a boarding party onto his flagship:
He leaps to his death.
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">16. Carter's strategy in ordering his fleet to retreat: To leave the
therns and First Born to fight each other.
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">17. Destination of a fleet of battleships and transports led by Xodar:
Temple of Issus.
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">18. Destination of the remainder of the fleet: To descend to the Sea
of Omean.
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">19. Obstacle placed by Carthoris in the Omean entrance shaft: Captured
First Born ships are wedged in the shaft.
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">20. News of Dejah Thoris from the sub commander: Issus and her followers
knew her to be the wife and mother of the only two men to escape the First
Born.
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">21. Where the sub commander last saw Dejah Thoris: The day before at
the monthly rites were she served at the foot of Issus.
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">22.&nbsp; Reason for Carter's miscalculation of the year's length:&nbsp;
Barsoomian days are 24 hours and 41 minutes while the years number 687
days.
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">23. The place where Issus will imprison Dejah Thoris for 687 days when
she learns that Carter approaches: The Temple of the Sun.
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">24. One possible fate of those locked in the chamber: Execution at
a predetermined time by an accompanying executioner.

tunnels leading to the pits of Issus:&nbsp; 5,000
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">2. Concern over the water levels in the pool chamber: The water is
steadily rising and will soon fill the chambers.
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">3. Reason for the water rise: The pumps of Omean have stopped.
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">4. Carter's decision when the waters reached waist level in the tunnel:
He orders half the force to file into a higher side tunnel.
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">5. Obstacle to the front of the column: The First Born have lit a chemical
fire in the passage producing a wall of flames and smoke.
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">6. Carter's reason for approaching the flames after directing his men
into an alternate tunnel: To make sure none are left behind.
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">7. Obstacle faced upon his return: An invisible foe has lowered a massive
steel grate to block one of the escape routes.
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">8. Carter's good fortune upon returning to the main corridor: There
is enough air space above the water for him to swim along the passage.
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">9. Problem posed by a dip in the tunnel: Carter has to swim blindly
underwater hoping he can make it to the air pocket.

Princess of Helium.

pits beyond the chamber door.
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">3. Carter's actions accompanying his shout of "For Helium!": He attacks
the temple guards from the rear.
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">4. Historic significance of this battle between the red and black races:
Battle between old and new ~ a victory by the red men would bring about
a new order on the planet.
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">5. An amazing sight in the gardens of Issus that demoralized the First
Born: A great horde of attacking green warriors mounted on thoats followed
by waves of red Martians warriors.
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">6. Commander of the green warriors: Tars Tarkas
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">7. Sight that met Carter and Carthoris when they rush into Dejah Thoris'

room: Issus
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">10. Retribution brought against the invaders by the "Goddess of Death
and Life Eternal," the all-powerful "Daughter of the Lesser Moon": None,
only insane babble and hysterical laughter.
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">11. Fate of Dejah Thoris, Thuvia and Phaidor: A year's imprisonment
and starvation in the Temple of the Sun.
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">12. Fate of Issus, the false god: Carter tosses her to her betrayed
and vengeful followers.
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">13. Act of revenge of the First Born necessitating the immediate evacuation
of everyone: They set fire to the Temple of Issus.
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">14. The women's chances for survival: Their prison chamber will protect
them from smoke and flames ~ Xodar has brought them a year's supply of
food.
</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">15. The last scene Carter saw before the chamber sealed for a year:
Phaidor attacking Dejah Thoris with a dagger and Thuvia trying to intervene.
