<p><b><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">Commonsense would suggest that, as the human race slowly evolved in
Africa and differentiated itself from the other primates, various viruses
parasitic upon primates changed too. It is known that there are several
viruses similar to AIDS in Africa: Simian Immunodeficiency Virus (SIV),
for example, which doesn't seem to do African primates (monkeys and the
like) any harm. But when monkeys from Asia are infected with SIV, they get
a disease remarkably similar to AIDS! The obvious conclusion is that at
one time SIV was deadly to African monkeys too, but through continued simian
evolution, it gradually became a benign and then apparently harmless disease,
rather like the way chickenpox is with us. And then there is also HIV-2,
found mostly in West Africa, which infects those living in that region,
but is rarely fatal. It does not take much imagination to suppose that when
HIV-2 first arose in West Africa, it was a virulent disease that killed
almost everyone it infected. But over the course of time, it has become
a chronic disease.</kw><br>
<br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
There is plenty of evidence in human history that when Europeans began to
spread out of their little corner of the earth (I'm tempted to refer to
it as a "metastatis") they carried two lethal weapons with them:
measles and smallpox. That was why Europeans attained their prominence in
the world: (unintended) biological warfare-not to mention giving the original
inhabitants of this continent blankets from Europeans suffering from smallpox!
There is documented evidence that the disease we call AIDS has been around
for a long time, but much of this evidence comes from Europe. Thus the naturalized
French writer Mirko Grmek says in his History of AIDS, "Serologic studies
pointed to the notion of the relative antiquity of HIV-1 infection in the
rural areas of Zaire and Kenya" (p. 177).</kw><br>
<br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
A more severe form of Kaposi's sarcoma, according to Grmek, was recognized
in Nigeria: . . . English, Belgian, and French doctors reported isolated
cases in Uganda and the Congo, without seeing them as indicators of an important
epidemic. The epidemic dimensions were not apparent until 1948. (pp. 113-14)
</kw><br>
<br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
To me, this paragraph has an eerie ring. The material I reported reading
in 1955 (see "Merchants of AIDS," Feb./Mar. North Coast Xpress)said
that work on the disease began in the winter of 1947-48 with a literature
search. (This is exactly what I would do if starting a new project, a literature
search, which of course is now much easier due to data banks.) To whom was
the dimension of the epidemic apparent in 1948? People in this country doing
work on biological warfare? Grmek's book was published in 1991! Grmek traces
the origin of the present AIDS epidemic as follows:</kw><br>
<br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
Retrospectively, the beginning of the present flare-up can be suspected
from the multiplicity of aggressive Kaposi's sarcoma cases in equatorial
Africa starting at mid-century. [Emphasis mine.] It became especially conspicuous
in the early 1960s among the seasonal workers who came down to South Africa
from the central regions with highly malignant Kaposi's complicated by fatal
meningitides and pneumonitides.</kw><br>
<br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
Readers of the first of my articles may recall that the person who gave
me the apparently highly classified material to read in 1955 was a French
mining engineer who had worked in South Africa until 1950. Did he also see
these cases? He spoke three African languages: Swahili, Zulu, and Xhosa,
though the latter two languages are as close as Spanish and Portuguese.
Clearly, if he wanted to, he could have asked the Africans in their own
languages about their illnesses.</kw><br>
<br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
It might be noted that one of the lesser-known activities of the American
government is to monitor diseases and epidemics around the world. Would
any reader of this article believe that a new disease starting about 1950
could have been unknown to someone in the American government by 1978, when
the AIDS epidemic began in this country? Does not the historical evidence
suggest a deliberate attempt not to inform the American people about AIDS?</kw><br>
<br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
HETEROSEXUAL AIDS IN AFRICA Sexual relations in africa have always been
more relaxed than in Europe. But after the 1950s, war and revolution tore
African nations apart. Huge movements of population began, some of them
armies, some of them refugees; the customary tribal restrictions disintegrated.
Grmek comments that ". . . overpopulation and overcopulation grew together
. . . . the inhabitants of the big cities abandoned themselves heartily
to elaborate sexual play" (p. 177). Even before the AIDS epidemic began,
this had predictable results. Stephen Joseph, M.D. in Dragon Within the
Gates, reports that in 1972 it was estimated that "at any one time
10 percent of the adult population of the [Central African] city had gonorrhea."
How fast could AIDS spread, as it has done in Africa, given the right conditions?
The answer comes not from Africa, but from the fleshpots of Asia:</kw><br>
<br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
Later, in 1991, in Thailand, the combination of sexual transmission and
intravenous drug use among prostitutes, their pimps, and customers led to
the most explosive rate of HIV increase in prevalence yet recorded, going
from virtually zero to the range of 50 percent infection rates among IV
drug users and prostitutes within a two-year period. (Dr. Stephen Joseph,
Dragon Within the Gates, p. 21). </kw><br>
<br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
There were those who had the foresight to peer into the future of Africa,
and they trembled. As Henry Hobhouse points out in Forces of Change, AIDS
could "destroy one-third of the population of tropical Africa . . .
. AIDS is the first disease since 1347 which is likely to have similar consequences
to the Black Death." The Black Death killed one-third of Europe's population.
</kw><br>
<br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
By October 1993, Hobhouse's estimate seemed to be far too low. An Associated
Press report dated October 17, 1993, says: "One out of eight Ugandans
are infected with the AIDS virus . . . . two million of Uganda's seventeen
million people are carrying the AIDS virus . . . . as Dr. Elizabeth Madra
(a Ugandan official) said, 'The nation is in danger of losing most of its
people'." The Black Death was beginning to seem positively benign by
comparison! In that epidemic one out of two who caught the disease died;
thus it had a mortality rate of 50 percent.</kw><br>
<br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
THE VIRUS THAT AIDS MUTATED FROM? I'm going to claim a world record that
I don't think anyone else will try to claim. I've had Kaposi's sarcoma for
more than 50 years. This apparently started when I was ten years old. I
underwent an operation for acute appendicitis (perhaps peritonitis) and
had a blood transfusion. In September 1942 I attended high school for the
first time, and had to change for gym class. While I was more or less naked,
one of my schoolmates looked at me, pointed to my right lower torso and
said, "What's that you've got? Is it catching?" I looked where
he was pointing, and for the first time became aware of four hot purple-pink
lesions there. The pattern reminded me of a star constellation and still
does. These peculiar marks were painless, didn't itch, and didn't seem to
change, and after that, I forgot about them. I assumed that they were some
sort of birthmark, and those who saw them subsequently thought they were
too.</kw><br>
<br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
It was not until my forties that I became aware that there were more of
these flat, painless, hot purple-pink marks appearing on my body, mostly
upon the abdomen. They were microscopic when first seen, but gradually grew
bigger, as did the original "gang of four" lesions. As I grew
even older, more and more of these marks became visible, though to this
day none of them can be seen when I'm dressed. By my late fifties, I began
to examine these peculiar marks through a magnifying glass; that in itself
was enough to scare me; they were clearly tumors, with tentacles reaching
out into the surrounding flesh. By that time there were so many it looked
as if someone had aimed at me with a shotgun.</kw><br>
<br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
In the late spring of 1990, I went to a skin cancer clinic as I had a nasty
looking black lesion on my shoulder (my son-in-law had just been operated
on for malignant melanoma). The doctor assured me it was really a wart,
but also looked at my plentiful display of lesions and said, "They
are angiomas." Angi means 'of the blood'; -oma means 'carcinogenic,'
as in carcinoma. I asked the logical question: "I have cancer of the
capillaries?" </kw><br>
<br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
"Yes," he replied, giving me a look that clearly indicated I was
not long for this world, then quickly walked out before I could say anything
else. Obviously he didn't want to be around a person with AIDS like me.
Kaposi's sarcoma is cancer of the capillaries. But I don't have AIDS; I
have something that looks exactly like it, what is known as indolent Kaposi's
sarcoma. This is such a rare disease that nobody knows anything about it;
in particular, nobody knows what the relation of indolent Kaposi's sarcoma
is to AIDS. There have only been about two hundred cases worldwide since
this disease was first diagnosed in the late 1870s; that's why we don't
know much about it.</kw><br>
<br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
My weight has not varied more than plus or minus 5 pounds for years. So
whatever I've got, it doesn't make me waste away. These lesions on my body
seem not to have harmed me at all! I'm 62 years old, disabled due to back
injury, and what I've got is not sexually transmitted. I've been married
for 33 years to the same woman, and she doesn't have any hot purple-pink
lesions on her body. Apparently the only way to get it is by a blood transfusion!
Wouldn't you think that some medical authority would be interested in looking
into this? Not the medical profession where I live, which is a long way
from Occidental, not even in California. The last time I tried to arouse
some interest in someone looking at my condition, such as taking a sample
of my blood, getting a biopsy of one of my original four tumors, and getting
something done, I was told to go home and forget about it. That's what people
with AIDS are told, "Go home and forget about </kw><em><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">it." </kw></em></b></p><hr>
<p></p><center><em><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">I can't travel, as I'm disabled, but I am waiting for someone
in the medical profession to feel that this case is worth investigating
and contact me (702) 565-8858. A case of indolent Kaposi's sarcoma, one
of the rarest diseases in the world? Perhaps there's a vital clue here on
how to treat AIDS, even render AIDS non-lethal, arrest the progress of AIDS?
You would think someone would be interested. I'm still waiting . </kw></em><hr></center>
