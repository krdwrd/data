</kw></b></font></p>
<p><i><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">Endowed with immense talent, M. L. Vasanthakumari explored areas others 
would not venture to touch, observes SULOCHANA PATTABHIRAMAN in her tribute to 
MLV, who passed away 12 years ago. </kw></i></p>
<p>
<img src="../pictures/mlv.jpg" align="middle" border="1" height="212" width="350"></p>
<p align="justify"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">IT IS with a heavy heart that I muster courage to pay tribute 
to you, MLV, on the solemn occasion of your 12th death anniversary. I, like so 
many others, am aware of the superb quality of your art and can appreciate the 
ceaseless efforts and hard work behind your numerous achievements. No language 
has words enough to compliment you on your various roles in life, as a daughter, 
wife, mother, disciple, extraordinary musician, guru, playback singer, friend 
and much above all, a human being in every sense of the word. You were veritably 
the Rani of Jhansi of Carnatic music, boldly entering areas that even angels 
would fear to tread. </kw></p>
<p align="justify"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">Why had fate to deal with you so heartlessly, depriving you 
of even the Biblical span of three score and ten? It was cruel to have been 
snatched away so early — You, whose initials symbolised Melody, Laya and Vidwath, 
you, who knew not to be worldly, you, who never dictated terms for your 
priceless art, you who hardly ever uttered a harsh word, you who never hesitated 
to encourage and appreciate budding talent, you who were an embodiment of love 
and compassion, you who cared genuinely for your fellow human beings. You have 
hardly ever hankered after recognition, awards and honours, they just came into 
your life as a matter of course and you accepted them with grace. You never 
bothered about statistics, you were averse to talking about your 
accomplishments, much less were you inclined to listen to your recorded music. 
The only criterion for you, having accepted an engagement whether in a temple, a 
wedding or a prestigious sabha, was to earnestly strive to give of your best.
</kw></p>
<p align="justify"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">On one occasion, Bade Ghulam Ali Khan was thrilled to hear 
Hindolam so delicately and melodiously woven by you, and had difficulty in 
finding words to express his appreciation. He simply took your hands in his as 
much as to say ``You are matchless." You strode the world of Carnatic music like 
a colossus for more than forty years and for your admirers to lose such an 
artiste is sorrow enough, but to lose a friend with such rare human values is a 
great personal loss. </kw></p>
<p align="justify"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">Your Guru, the legendary G. N. Balasubramaniam instantly 
recognised your brilliant talent and honed your skill with the supreme 
confidence that here was one who would keep the GNB torch alive. It is also a 
fact that you evolved an innovative style of your own to capture the hearts of 
thousands of your rasikas. The devoted disciple you were, you paid homage to 
your guru by popularising his compositions through your concerts and audio 
recordings. Your enthusiasm to make frequent additions to your already extensive 
repertoire was remarkable. It cannot be gainsaid that the compositions of the 
Haridasas of Karnataka acquired greater dimensions because of your singular 
efforts to propagate and popularise them for which you were conferred a 
doctorate by the University of Mysore. Music was so much second nature to you 
that you would sit through a cricket match till 4 p.m. and proceed straight to 
the Music Academy to give yet another copy book performance. Your spontaneity of 
musical expression was unparalleled. There was hardly any preplanning for most 
of your recitals and even your disciples who sang with you, had no clue until 
you started the opening lyric of each song. It is not an exaggeration to say 
that in some of your concerts, you composed the pallavi minutes before rendering 
it in all its glory and splendour — anulomam, pratilomam, niraval, swara 
improvisations for tricky take off points, kuraippu and the grand ragamalika 
garland in sweet melodies such as Bowli, Sahana, Behag, Sekharachandrika, Tilang, 
Sindhubhairavi, Revati, Hamsanandi, </kw><i><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">et al</kw></i><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">, and reversing the order to 
culminate in a superb korvai hitting the Pallavi eduppu bang on target. This 
scribe has known you to compose a Sankeerna nadai Pallavi on the spur of the 
moment and render it flawlessly before one of the most discerning and 
enlightened audiences at the Shanmukhananda Hall, Mumbai. </kw></p>
<p align="justify"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">Handling ragas like Malavi, Andolika, Saranga tharangini, 
Sivasakthi, Mohanakalyani, etc. was child's play to you, and your audience, 
enthralled, would wonder how janya ragas even with a limited scope could be 
elaborated so wonderfully without repetition of prayogas. Your nadai pallavis, 
sung with clockwork precision, were object lessons to vidwans and vidyartis 
alike. The Todi raga has earned the reputation of being the King of ragas and 
you were the uncrowned queen in its detailed delineation, unfolding it with a 
regal splendour and bringing into focus all its radiant hues. The presentation 
would be kaleidoscopic and the audience reaction euphoric. Your tanams were 
vibrant, vivacious and virtuous. </kw></p>
<p align="justify"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">You had redefined the art of kalpanaswara singing with your 
imaginative patterns rising to soaring heights, while the audience listened with 
bated breath in anticipation of the crescendo and then the thundering applause, 
which you would acknowledge modestly with folded hands. </kw></p>
<p align="justify"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">Somehow you had not much preference for vivadi ragas, though 
you included Tyagaraja's ``Maravairi" in Nasikabhooshani, ``Bagayanayya" and ``Sasivadana" 
in Chandrajyothi, ``Ganamurthe" in Ganamurthi and a few of Koteeswara Iyer in 
your agenda. </kw></p>
<p align="justify"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">Your ragamalika viruttams and slokas would transport one to 
the seventh heaven of delight and devotion with their soulful appeal, combining 
bhakti and bhava. Your Marathi Abhangs, Hindi Bhajans and Tiruppavai, would 
create a mood of contemplation, while the tillanas spread immense joy and cheer.
</kw></p>
<p align="justify"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">The variety in your musical outfit was nothing short of 
breath taking. You were adept at public speaking that was marked by fluency, 
clarity and brevity. Being a linguist, you were proficient to speak extempore in 
English, Tamil, Telugu and Kannada. Your accompanists, whether senior or junior, 
considered it a great honour to provide support to an artiste of your calibre, 
for they were assured of cent per cent cooperation and encouragement from you. 
Among the disciples, Trichur Ramachandran, Charumathi, Sudha Raghunathan and 
Jayanthi Mohan, to name but a few, have done you real proud. But the one whose 
latent talent you fine-tuned to a large extent, and one who has made a mark for 
herself as an outstanding accompanist is Kanyakumari who acknowledges with 
gratitude your important role in moulding her art. </kw></p>
<p align="justify"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">The memorable concert at the Srinivasa Sastri Hall with the 
much-revered vidwan Palghat Mani Iyer accompanying you on the mridangam, is to 
be cherished forever. Discipline was the bottom line in your recitals. You have 
travelled far and wide and you have been an excellent ambassador of Indian art 
and culture. </kw></p>
<p align="justify"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">The Rishi Valley School at Madanapalle was fortunate to have 
you adorn its musical faculty for some years. You directed and presented the 
dance drama ``Sakuntalam" with the participation of the students of the Rishi 
Valley School at the Music Academy in 1988, that was a testament to your deep 
involvement with the institution. </kw></p>
<p align="justify"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">In the celluloid sphere, you created waves in the 1950s and 
1960s and with music director C. R. Subbaraman, you made a sparkling twosome 
producing music that would retain an enduring fragrance, defying the passage of 
time. </kw></p>
<p align="justify"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">You bade farewell 12 long years ago, but those of us left 
behind constantly remember that you came, you sang and you conquered. When shall 
we see the like of you again? </kw></p>
