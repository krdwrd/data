      It was the eve of Aids Day here. Rock stars like Bono and Bob Geldof were 
      jetting in for a fundraising concert with Nelson Mandela, and the airwaves 
      were full of dark talk about megadeath and the armies of feral orphans who 
      would surely ransack South Africa’s cities in 2017 unless funds were made 
      available to take care of them. My neighbour came up the garden path with 
      a press cutting. ‘Read this,’ said Capt. David Price, ex-Royal Air Force 
      flyboy. ‘Bloody awful.’ </kw><br>
      <br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
      It was an article from </kw><b><i><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">The Spectator</kw></i></b><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3"> describing the bizarre 
      sex practices that contribute to HIV’s rampage across the continent. ‘One 
      in five of us here in Zambia is HIV positive,’ said the report. ‘In 1993 
      our neighbour Botswana had an estimated population of 1.4 million. Today 
      that figure is under a million and heading downwards. Doom merchants 
      predict that Botswana may soon become the first nation in modern times 
      literally to die out. This is Aids in Africa.’</kw><br>
      <br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
      Really? Botswana has just concluded a census that shows population growing 
      at about 2.7 per cent a year, in spite of what is usually described as the 
      worst Aids problem on the planet. Total population has risen to 1.7 
      million in just a decade. If anything, Botswana is experiencing a minor 
      population explosion.</kw><br>
      <br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
      There is similar bad news for the doomsayers in Tanzania’s new census, 
      which shows population growing at 2.9 per cent a year. Professional 
      pessimists will be particularly discomforted by developments in the 
      swamplands west of Lake Victoria, where HIV first emerged, and where the 
      depopulated villages of popular mythology are supposedly located. Here, in 
      the district of Kagera, population grew at 2.7 per cent a year before 
      1988, only to accelerate to 3.1 per cent even as the Aids epidemic was 
      supposedly peaking. Uganda’s latest census tells a broadly similar story, 
      as does South Africa’s.</kw><br>
      <br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
      Some might think it good news that the impact of Aids is less devastating 
      than most laymen imagine, but they are wrong. In Africa, the only good 
      news about Aids is bad news, and anyone who tells you otherwise is branded 
      a moral leper, bent on sowing confusion and derailing 100,000 worthy 
      fundraising drives. I know this, because several years ago I acquired what 
      was generally regarded as a leprous obsession with the dumbfounding Aids 
      numbers in my daily papers. They told me that Aids had claimed 250,000 
      South African lives in 1999, and I kept saying, this can’t possibly be 
      true. What followed was very ugly — ruined dinner parties, broken 
      friendships, ridicule from those who knew better, bitter fights wit</kw></p>

      <br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
      As I write, madam is standing behind me with hands on hips, hugely irked 
      by this reversion to bad habits. But looking around, it seems to me that 
      Aids fever is nearing the danger level, and that some calming thoughts are 
      called for. Bear with me while I explain.</kw><br>
      <br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
      We all know, thanks to Mark Twain, that statistics are often the lowest 
      form of lie, but when it comes to HIV/Aids, we suspend all scepticism. 
      Why? Aids is the most political disease ever. We have been fighting about 
      it since the day it was identified. The key battleground is public 
      perception, and the most deadly weapon is the estimate. When the virus 
      first emerged, I was living in America, where HIV incidence was estimated 
      to be doubling every year or so. Every time I turned on the TV, Madonna 
      popped up to warn me that ‘Aids is an equal-opportunity killer’, poised to 
      break out of the drug and gay subcultures and slaughter heterosexuals. In 
      1985, a science journal estimated that 1.7 million Americans were already 
      infected, with ‘three to five million’ soon likely to follow suit. Oprah 
      Winfrey told the nation that by 1990 ‘one in five heterosexuals will be 
      dead of Aids’.</kw><br>
      <br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
      We now know that these estimates were vastly and indeed deliberately 
      exaggerated, but they achieved the desired end: Aids was catapulted to the 
      top of the West’s spending agenda, and the estimators turned their 
      attention elsewhere. India’s epidemic was likened to ‘a volcano waiting to 
      explode’. Africa faced ‘a tidal wave of death’. By 1992 they were 
      estimating that ‘Aids could clear the whole planet’.</kw><br>
      <br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
      Who were they, these estimators? For the most part, they worked in Geneva 
      for WHO or UNAIDS, using a computer simulator called Epimodel. Every year, 
      all over Africa, blood would be taken from a small sample of pregnant 
      women and screened for signs of HIV infection. The results would be 
      programmed into Epimodel, which transmuted them into estimates. If so many 
      women were infected, it followed that a similar proportion of their 
      husbands and lovers must be infected, too. These numbers would be 
      extrapolated out into the general population, enabling the computer 
      modellers to arrive at seemingly precise tallies of the doomed, the dying 
      and the orphans left behind.</kw><br>
      <br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
      Because Africa is disorganised and, in some parts, unknowable, we had 
      little choice other than to accept these projections. (‘We’ always expect 
      the worst of Africa anyway.) Reporting on Aids in Africa became a quest 
      for anecdotes to support Geneva’s estimates, and the estimates grew ever 
      more terrible: 9.6 million cumulative Aids deaths by 1997, rising to 17 
      million three years later. </kw><br>
      <br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
      Or so we were told. When I visited the worst affected parts of Tanzania 
      and Uganda in 2001, I was overwhelmed with stories about the horrors of 
      what locals called ‘Slims’, but statistical corroboration was hard to come 
      by. According to government census bureaux, death rates in these areas had 
      been in decline since the second world war. Aids-era mortality studies 
      yielded some of the lowest overall death rates ever measured. Populations 
      seemed to have exploded even as the epidemic was peaking.</kw><br>
      <br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
      Ask Aids experts about this, and they say, this is Africa, chaos reigns, 
      the historical data is too uncertain to make valid comparisons. But these 
      same experts will tell you that South Africa is vastly different: ‘The 
      only country in sub-Saharan Africa where sufficient deaths are routinely 
      registered to attempt to produce national estimates of mortality,’ says 
      Professor Ian Timaeus of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical 
      Medicine. According to Timaeus, upwards of 80 per cent of deaths are 
      registered here, which makes us unique: the only corner of Africa where it 
      is possible to judge computer-generated Aids estimates against objective 
      reality. </kw><br>
      <br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
      In the year 2000, Timaeus joined a team of South African researchers bent 
      on eliminating all doubts about the magnitude of Aids’ impact on South 
      African mortality. Sponsored by the Medical Research Council, the team’s 
      mission was to validate (for the first time ever) the output of Aids 
      computer models against actual death registration in an African setting. 
      Towards this end, the MRC team was granted privileged access to death 
      reports as they streamed into Pretoria. The first results became available 
      in 2001, and they ran thus: 339,000 adult deaths in 1998, 375,000 in 1999 
      and 410,000 in 2000.</kw><br>
      <br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
      This was grimly consistent with predictions of rising mortality, but the 
      scale was problematic. Epimodel estimated 250,000 Aids deaths in 1999, but 
      there were only 375,000 adult deaths in total that year — far too few to 
      accommodate the UN’s claims on behalf of the HIV virus. In short, Epimodel 
      had failed its reality check. It was quietly shelved in favour of a more 
      sophisticated local model, ASSA 600, which yielded a ‘more realistic’ 
      death toll from Aids of 143,000 for the calendar year 1999. </kw><br>
      <br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
      At this level, Aids deaths were about 40 per cent of the total — still a 
      bit high, considering there were only 232,000 deaths left to distribute 
      among all other causes. The MRC team solved the problem by stating that 
      deaths from ordinary disease had declined at the cumulatively massive rate 
      of nearly 3 per cent per annum since 1985. This seemed very odd. How could 
      deaths decrease in the face of new cholera and malaria epidemics, mounting 
      poverty, the widespread emergence of drug-resistant killer microbes, and a 
      state health system reported to be in ‘terminal decline’?</kw><br>
      <br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
      But anyway, these researchers were experts, and their tinkering achieved 
      the desired end: modelled Aids deaths and real deaths were reconciled, the 
      books balanced, truth revealed. The fruit of the MRC’s ground-breaking 
      labour was published in June 2001, and my hash appeared to have been 
      settled. To be sure, I carped about curious adjustments and overall 
      magnitude, but fell silent in the face of graphs showing huge changes in 
      the pattern of death, with more and more people dying at sexually active 
      ages. ‘How can you argue with this?’ cried my wife, eyes flashing angrily. 
      I couldn’t. I put my Aids papers in the garage and ate my hat.</kw><br>
      <br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
      But I couldn’t help sneaking the odd look at science websites to see how 
      the drama was developing. Towards the end of 2001, the vaunted ASSA 600 
      model was replaced by ASSA 2000, which produced estimates even lower than 
      its predecessor: for the calendar year 1999, only 92,000 Aids deaths in 
      total. This was just more than a third of the original UN figure, but no 
      matter; the boffins claimed ASSA 2000 was so accurate that further 
      reference to actual death reports ‘will be of limited usefulness’. A bit 
      eerie, I thought, being told that virtual reality was about to render the 
      real thing superfluous, but if these experts said the new model was 
      infallible, it surely was infallible.</kw><br>
      <br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
      Only it wasn’t. Last December ASSA 2000 was retired, too. A note on the 
      MRC website explained that modelling was an inexact science, and that ‘the 
      number of people dying of Aids has only now started to increase’. 
      Furthermore, said the MRC, there was a new model in the works, one that 
      would ‘probably’ produce estimates ‘about 10 per cent lower’ than those 
      presently on the table. The exercise was not strictly valid, but I 
      persuaded my scientist pal Rodney Richards to run the revised data on his 
      own simulator and see what he came up with for 1999. The answer, very 
      crudely, was an Aids death toll somewhere around 65,000 — a far cry indeed 
      from the 250,000 initially put forth by UNAIDS. </kw><br>
      <br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
      The wife has just read this, and she is not impressed. ‘It’s obscene,’ she 
      says. ‘You’re treating this as if it’s just a computer game. People are 
      dying out there.’</kw><br>
      <br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
      Well, yes. I concede that. People are dying, but this doesn’t spare us 
      from the fact that Aids in Africa is indeed something of a computer game. 
      When you read that 29.4 million Africans are ‘living with HIV/Aids’, it 
      doesn’t mean that millions of living people have been tested. It means 
      that modellers assume that 29.4 million Africans are linked via enormously 
      complicated mathematical and sexual networks to one of those women who 
      tested HIV positive in those annual pregnancy-clinic surveys. Modellers 
      are the first to admit that this exercise is subject to uncertainties and 
      large margins of error. Larger than expected, in some cases.</kw><br>
      <br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
      A year or so back, modellers produced estimates that portrayed South 
      African universities as crucibles of rampant HIV infection, with one in 
      four undergraduates doomed to die within ten years. Prevalence shifted 
      according to racial composition and region, with Kwazulu-Natal 
      institutions worst affected and Rand Afrikaans University (still 70 per 
      cent white) coming in at 9.5 per cent. Real-life tests on a random sample 
      of 1,188 RAU students rendered a startlingly different conclusion: 
      on-campus prevalence was 1.1 per cent, barely a ninth of the modelled 
      figure. ‘Doubt is cast on present estimates,’ said the RAU report, ‘and 
      further research is strongly advocated.’</kw><br>
      <br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
      A similar anomaly emerged when South Africa’s major banks ran HIV tests on 
      29,000 staff earlier this year. A modelling exercise put HIV prevalence as 
      high as 12 per cent; real-life tests produced a figure closer to 3 per 
      cent. Elsewhere, actuaries are scratching their heads over a puzzling lack 
      of interest in programs set up by medical-insurance companies to handle an 
      anticipated flood of middle-class HIV cases. Old Mutual, the insurance 
      giant, estimates that as many as 570,000 people are eligible, but only 
      22,500 have thus far signed up. </kw><br>
      <br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
      In Grahamstown, district surgeon Dr Stuart Dyer is contemplating an 
      equally perplexing dearth of HIV cases in the local jail. ‘Sexually 
      transmitted diseases are common in the prison where I work,’ he wrote to 
      the Lancet, ‘and all prisoners who have any such disease are tested for 
      HIV. Prisoners with any other illnesses that do not resolve rapidly 
      (within one to two weeks) are also tested for HIV. As a result, a large 
      number of HIV tests are done every week. This prison, which holds 550 
      inmates and is always full or overfull, has an HIV infection rate of 2 to 
      4 per cent and has had only two deaths from Aids in the seven years I have 
      been working there.’ Dyer goes on to express a dim view of statistics that 
      give the impression that ‘the whole of South Africa will be depopulated 
      within 24 months’, and concludes by stating, ‘HIV infection in SA prisons 
      is currently 2.3 per cent.’ According to the newspapers, it should be 
      closer to 60 per cent.</kw><br>
      <br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
      On the face of it, these developments suggest that miracles are happening 
      in South Africa, unreported by anyone save a brave little magazine called 
      Noseweek. If the anomalies described above are typical, computer models 
      are seriously overstating HIV prevalence. A similar picture emerges on the 
      national level, where our estimated annual Aids death toll has halved 
      since we eased UNAIDS out of the picture, with further reductions likely 
      when the new MRC model appears. Could the same thing be happening in the 
      rest of Africa?</kw><br>
      <br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
      Most estimates for countries north of the Limpopo are issued by UNAIDS, 
      using methods similar to those discredited here in South Africa. According 
      to Paul Bennell, a health- policy analyst associated with Sussex 
      University’s Institute for Development Studies, there is an 
      ‘extraordinary’ lack of evidence from other sources. ‘Most countries do 
      not even collect data on deaths,’ he writes. ‘There is virtually no 
      population-based survey data in most high-prevalence countries.’ </kw><br>
      <br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
      Bennell was able, however, to gather information about Africa’s 
      schoolteachers, usually described as a high-risk HIV group on account of 
      their steady income, which enables them to drink and party more than 
      others. Last year the World Bank claimed that Aids was killing Africa’s 
      teachers ‘faster than they can be replaced’. The BBC reported that ‘one in 
      seven’ Malawian teachers would die in 2002 alone.</kw><br>
      <br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
      Bennell looked at the available evidence and found actual teacher 
      mortality to be ‘much lower than expected’. In Malawi, for instance, the 
      all-causes death rate among schoolteachers was under 3 per cent, not over 
      14 per cent. In Botswana, it was about three times lower than 
      computer-generated estimates. In Zimbabwe, it was four times lower. 
      Bennell believes that Aids continues to present a serious threat to 
      educators, but concludes that ‘overall impact will not be as catastrophic 
      as suggested’. What’s more, teacher deaths appear to be declining in six 
      of the eight countries he has studied closely. ‘This is quite unexpected,’ 
      he remarks, ‘and suggests that, in terms of teacher deaths, the worst may 
      be over.’</kw><br>
      <br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
      In the past year or so, similar mutterings have been heard throughout 
      southern Africa — the epidemic is levelling off or even declining in the 
      worst-affected countries. UNAIDS has been at great pains to rebut such 
      ideas, describing them as ‘dangerous myths’, even though the data on 
      UNAIDS’ own website shows they are nothing of the sort. ‘The epidemic is 
      not growing in most countries,’ insists Bennell. ‘HIV prevalence is not 
      increasing as is usually stated or implied.’</kw><br>
      <br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
      Bennell raises an interesting point here. Why would UNAIDS and its massive 
      alliance of pharmaceutical companies, NGOs, scientists and charities 
      insist that the epidemic is worsening if it isn’t? A possible explanation 
      comes from New York physician Joe Sonnabend, one of the pioneers of Aids 
      research. Sonnabend was working in a New York clap clinic when the 
      syndrome first appeared, and went on to found the American Foundation for 
      Aids Research, only to quit in protest when colleagues started 
      exaggerating the threat of a generalised pandemic with a view to 
      increasing Aids’ visibility and adding urgency to their grant 
      applications. The Aids establishment, says Sonnabend, is extremely skilled 
      at ‘the manipulation of fear for advancement in terms of money and power’.</kw><br>
      <br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
      With such thoughts in the back of my mind, South Africa’s Aids Day 
      ‘celebrations’ cast me into a deeply leprous mood. Please don’t get me 
      wrong here. I believe that Aids is a real problem in Africa. Governments 
      and sober medical professionals should be heeded when they express deep 
      concerns about it. But there are breeds of Aids activist and Aids 
      journalist who sound hysterical to me. On Aids Day, they came forth like 
      loonies drawn by a full moon, chanting that Aids was getting worse and 
      worse, ‘spinning out of control’, crippling economies, causing famines, 
      killing millions, contributing to the oppression of women, and 
      ‘undermining democracy’ by sapping the will of the poor to resist 
      dictators. </kw><br>
      <br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
      To hear them talk, Aids is the only problem in Africa, and the only 
      solution is to continue the agitprop until free access to Aids drugs is 
      defined as a ‘basic human right’ for everyone. They are saying, in effect, 
      that because Mr Mhlangu of rural Zambia has a disease they find more 
      compelling than any other, someone must spend upwards of $400 a year to 
      provide Mr Mhlangu with life-extending Aids medication — a noble idea, on 
      its face, but completely demented when you consider that Mr Mhlangu’s 
      neighbours are likely to be dying in much larger numbers of diseases that 
      could be cured for a few cents if medicines were only available. About 350 
      million Africans — nearly half the population — get malaria every year, 
      but malaria medication is not a basic human right. Two million get TB, but 
      last time I checked, spending on Aids research exceeded spending on TB by 
      a crushing factor of 90 to one. As for pneumonia, cancer, dysentery or 
      diabetes, let them take aspirin, or grub in the !</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
      bush for medicinal herbs.</kw><br>
      <br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
      I think it is time to start questioning some of the claims made by the 
      Aids lobby. Their certainties are so fanatical, the powers they claim so 
      far-reaching. Their authority is ultimately derived from 
      computer-generated estimates, which they wield like weapons, overwhelming 
      any resistance with dumbfounding atom bombs of hypothetical human misery. 
      Give them their head, and they will commandeer all resources to fight just 
      one disease. Who knows, they may defeat Aids, but what if we wake up five 
      years hence to discover that the problem has been blown up out of all 
      proportion by unsound estimates, causing upwards of $20 billion to be
