					<h2><kw class="krdwrd-tag-2">Mobile Phone Use and Policy in Southern Africa: </kw></h2>
					<b><kw class="krdwrd-tag-2">by Tim Sanders</kw></b>
					<p class="subHeading"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-2">Introduction</kw></p>
					<p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">In this article I take an anecdotal look at mobile phone use and policy in </kw><em><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">Southern Africa</kw></em><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">. During the time I spent in </kw><em><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">Southern Africa</kw></em><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3"> in 2003 and 2004 I was continually amazed by the extent to which mobile phones have pervaded the culture in each country. Mobile telephony appears to be revolutionizing the region, and it is interesting to consider the issues surrounding the industry from an African perspective. I will spend the balance of this article discussing in separate essays three issues of importance to the mobile phone industry in </kw><em><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">Southern Africa</kw></em><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">.</kw></p>
					<p class="subHeading"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-2">Mobile Phone Regulation and Usage Patterns</kw></p>
					<p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">This essay looks at phone usage in the </kw><a target="_blank" href="http://www.sadc.int/" rel="external" class="ext_link"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">Southern African Development Community</kw></a><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">, a regional entity comprised of fourteen countries in </kw><em><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">Southern Africa</kw></em><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">. I choose to concentrate on the </kw><a target="_blank" href="http://www.sadc.int/" rel="external" class="ext_link"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">SADC</kw></a><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3"> because it is a cognizable and well-defined region of Africa with which I have personal experience. Of the fourteen countries in the </kw><a target="_blank" href="http://www.sadc.int/" rel="external" class="ext_link"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">SADC</kw></a><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">, I have travelled to eight and secured local mobile phone service in six.</kw></p>
					<p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">Although market penetration within the </kw><a target="_blank" href="http://www.sadc.int/" rel="external" class="ext_link"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">SADC</kw></a><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3"> remains small at just over 9%, mobile phone use in Africa as a whole has been growing at a rate of more than 50% per year, higher than that of any other continent. In addition, mobile phone use in the </kw><a target="_blank" href="http://www.sadc.int/" rel="external" class="ext_link"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">SADC</kw></a><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3"> region outstrips that of landline phones.</kw></p>
					<p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">Countries in the </kw><a target="_blank" href="http://www.sadc.int/" rel="external" class="ext_link"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">SADC</kw></a><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3"> vary tremendously with respect to mobile phone use. The percentage of population using mobile phones varies from 1% in </kw><a target="_blank" class="wikipediaProfile" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malawi" rel="external"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">Malawi</kw></a><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3"> and </kw><a target="_blank" class="wikipediaProfile" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angola" rel="external"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">Angola</kw></a><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3"> to 38% in </kw><a target="_blank" class="wikipediaProfile" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_africa" rel="external"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">South Africa</kw></a><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3"> and </kw><a target="_blank" class="wikipediaProfile" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mauritius" rel="external"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">Mauritius</kw></a><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">. Almost all of this variance can be explained by income; there is a correlation of .96 between per-capita GDP and mobile phone percentage use among the countries of the </kw><a target="_blank" href="http://www.sadc.int/" rel="external" class="ext_link"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">SADC</kw></a><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">.</kw></p>
					<p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">Regardless of the percentage of mobile phone use in any given country, it is unilaterally the case that mobile phones far outnumber landline phones in the </kw><a target="_blank" href="http://www.sadc.int/" rel="external" class="ext_link"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">SADC</kw></a><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">. Region-wide, mobile phones account for 77% of phone use, ranging from a low of 56% in </kw><a target="_blank" class="wikipediaProfile" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zimbabwe" rel="external"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">Zimbabwe</kw></a><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3"> to over 99% in the </kw><a target="_blank" class="wikipediaProfile" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_republic_of_Congo" rel="external"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">DRC</kw></a><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">.</kw></p>
					<p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">The </kw><em><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">July 7, 2005</kw></em><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">, issue of </kw><a target="_blank" href="http://www.economist.com/" rel="external" class="ext_link"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">The Economist</kw></a><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3"> included an editorial in which the authors described the mobile phone industry in Africa and suggested how enterprise could be stimulated if regulations were relaxed ("Less is More" 2005). The editorial described how government-imposed fees were stifling the growth of the mobile phone industry. I personally witnessed economic barriers to mobile phone use when I was in Africa, both in the form of government taxes and artificially high entry costs imposed by the service providers. In my experience, the most restrictive such regulation was the R50 (roughly US$7) monthly access fee charged by the </kw><em><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">Swazi</kw></em><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3"> government when I was there; this mandatory fee was directly imposed by the government and provided no benefit other than keeping the phone line active. In addition, in both </kw><a target="_blank" class="wikipediaProfile" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swaziland" rel="external"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">Swaziland</kw></a><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3"> and </kw><a target="_blank" class="wikipediaProfile" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namibia" rel="external"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">Namibia</kw></a><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3"> I was presented with only a single service provider to choose from, and in each case the service provider required a R100 (US$14) initial purchase, most of which was a sunk cost and did not convert into usable minutes.</kw></p>
					<p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">Contrast this with many parts of Africa (specifically </kw><a target="_blank" class="wikipediaProfile" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_africa" rel="external"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">South Africa</kw></a><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">, </kw><a target="_blank" class="wikipediaProfile" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozambique" rel="external"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">Mozambique</kw></a><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">, </kw><a target="_blank" class="wikipediaProfile" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botswana" rel="external"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">Botswana</kw></a><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">, and </kw><a target="_blank" class="wikipediaProfile" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zambia" rel="external"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">Zambia</kw></a><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">), where I was able to acquire a SIM card for free or virtually free with purchase of the prepaid airtime I loaded onto the card. In these countries, one's phone number would remain active so long as airtime was loaded onto the SIM card sufficiently frequently (my South African number is still active more than a year after I last loaded airtime). I have no doubt that the government fee imposed in </kw><a target="_blank" class="wikipediaProfile" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swaziland" rel="external"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">Swaziland</kw></a><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3"> has something to do with why mobile phone use appeared to be less prevalent there than elsewhere. Factor in the relatively high cost of airtime, as well as the fact that there was only one mobile provider in </kw><a target="_blank" class="wikipediaProfile" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namibia" rel="external"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">Namibia</kw></a><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3"> and </kw><a target="_blank" class="wikipediaProfile" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swaziland" rel="external"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">Swaziland</kw></a><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3"> when I was there.</kw></p>
					<p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">On the other hand, it should be equally unsurprising that </kw><a target="_blank" class="wikipediaProfile" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_africa" rel="external"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">South Africa</kw></a><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">, </kw><a target="_blank" class="wikipediaProfile" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozambique" rel="external"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">Mozambique</kw></a><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">, </kw><a target="_blank" class="wikipediaProfile" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botswana" rel="external"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">Botswana</kw></a><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">, and </kw><a target="_blank" class="wikipediaProfile" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zambia" rel="external"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">Zambia</kw></a><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3"> are the highest above the trend line of all the countries in which I purchased phone service. </kw><a target="_blank" class="wikipediaProfile" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_africa" rel="external"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">South Africa</kw></a><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3"> is by far the highest point above the trend line, which is indicative of the incredibly large choice and low barriers to entry in that market. In </kw><a target="_blank" class="wikipediaProfile" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_africa" rel="external"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">South Africa</kw></a><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3"> I had a choice among three mobile providers, and if I had so chosen I could have acquired a completely new phone number with each R29 (US$4) airtime purchase I made while there.</kw></p>
					<p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">The data presented here indicate that there may be something to the suggestion in The Economist that relaxation of regulations could lead to greater mobile phone use. Of course, any number of other factors could also contribute to the trends discussed above, and would be worth investigating in greater depth. But as a first-order attempt at analysis, it certainly appears that my anecdotal observations about pricing and access could have some explanatory power to describe some of the disparities with respect to mobile phone use in </kw><a target="_blank" class="wikipediaProfile" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_africa" rel="external"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">Southern Africa</kw></a><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">. Looking at the countries in which I purchased phone service, the deviations of their data points from the GDP/mobile use trend line all match up with my own observations on the restrictions in place regarding phone service pricing and startup costs.</kw></p>
					<p class="subHeading"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-2">Mobile Phone Theft</kw></p>
					<p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">Theft is a major problem confronting mobile phone users everywhere, but it appears to be particularly problematic in </kw><em><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">Southern Africa</kw></em><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">. In this essay I will focus on the issue as it relates to </kw><a target="_blank" class="wikipediaProfile" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_africa" rel="external"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">South Africa</kw></a><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">; after discussing a potential contributing factor I analyze a practical solution. To begin, let us contrast the operation of the mobile phone industry in </kw><a target="_blank" class="wikipediaProfile" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_africa" rel="external"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">South Africa</kw></a><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3"> with that of the </kw><em><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">US</kw></em><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">.</kw></p>
					<p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">In America, mobile phones are often given away free when a purchaser initiates service (as evidenced by the fact that you don't get much of a discount, if any, by bringing your own phone to the table), but the acquisition of a phone number and initiation of service are significant startup costs. In </kw><a target="_blank" class="wikipediaProfile" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_africa" rel="external"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">South Africa</kw></a><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">, phones themselves are typically not given away with service plans but acquiring a SIM card and service is a negligible expense. This gives rise to some interesting observations regarding the underlying circumstances that incentivize phone theft and what can be done to minimize it.</kw></p>
					<p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">In America, what's the point in stealing someone's phone? They call the service provider and have the SIM card deactivated, and the phone is no good to you unless you buy a new service plan that you could have gotten a free phone with anyway. The key here is that someone (the service provider in this case) has a record of the owner and a means to cut off access to the limiting commodity (in this case the phone service) at the owner's request. In addition, service is typically post-paid and the user therefore has an incentive to call to cancel service once the phone has been stolen.</kw></p>
					<p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">In </kw><a target="_blank" class="wikipediaProfile" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_africa" rel="external"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">South Africa</kw></a><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">, things are a little different. There are certainly advantages to the system in place in </kw><a target="_blank" class="wikipediaProfile" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_africa" rel="external"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">South Africa</kw></a><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3"> as compared to the American system, particularly as these differences go a long way toward enfranchising marginal users. A one-time hardware purchase provides virtually unlimited opportunity to augment phone service as often or as infrequently as the customer wishes, as well as the opportunity to change plans and providers with little or no effort. In addition, this one-time purchase coupled with pre-paid service replaces any need for credit checks and lengthy commitments and allows users at the fringe of the economy to tailor their usage patterns precisely to their needs and means. This is further enhanced by the fact that in most cases all incoming communication is free and, at the time I left </kw><a target="_blank" class="wikipediaProfile" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_africa" rel="external"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">South Africa</kw></a><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">, </kw><a target="_blank" href="http://www.vodacom.com/" rel="external" class="ext_link"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">Vodacom</kw></a><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3"> had just begun issuing airtime vouchers in increments as small as R12 (US$2).</kw></p>
					<p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">However, this convenience comes at a price when we consider the issue of theft. If you acquire a stolen phone in </kw><a target="_blank" class="wikipediaProfile" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_africa" rel="external"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">South Africa</kw></a><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">, it is a negligible expense to replace the SIM card and have a fully-functioning phone. Thus it would be no use to have a system that would allow a customer to deactivate a SIM card. The limiting commodity in this case is the phone, so that's what needs to be targeted.</kw></p>
					<p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">As it happens, </kw><a target="_blank" class="wikipediaProfile" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_africa" rel="external"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">South Africa</kw></a><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3"> has a national phone registry to accomplish just this. The nation's three mobile providers have an agreement that if you report the serial number of your stolen phone, they will blacklist the phone, rendering it unusable thenceforth. This action, if performed, essentially strips all economic benefit from the theft of a mobile phone. However, report rates are low enough that the risk of getting an unusable phone is not a sufficient deterrent to would-be phone thiefs. Why are not more stolen phones reported?</kw></p>
					<p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">Let's consider the endpoint first. What is the incentive for a victim to call and report the stolen phone? In many cases anger at being a victim of theft might be sufficient to prompt some people to call; even though they will receive no further benefit either way, they will get the satisfaction of knowing the perpetrator will not profit from the crime. If this incentive is strong enough, the low report rate could imply that victims are somehow unable to report the crime.</kw></p>
					<p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">As it turns out, when I was in </kw><a target="_blank" class="wikipediaProfile" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_africa" rel="external"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">South Africa</kw></a><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3"> owners of stolen phones were required to give the serial number in order for the phone to be blacklisted. Most mobile phone users do not have a record of this information, because no one expects to need it. Obviously phone owners would be able to report more thefts if they had the numbers recorded, but what is the incentive for a given phone user to record this information? It takes effort to record the serial number and effort to call to report a stolen phone, and again doing so confers no economic benefit on the mobile customer. So how can this behavior be incentivized?</kw></p>
					<p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">One article I came across described a proposal of criminal penalties for consumers who fail to report stolen phones (CellularOnline 2002). Of course, there are plenty of civil rights problems with such a proposal, not to mention the fact that a penalty that triggers only subsequent to an unexpected event still may not stir to action those for whom the prospect of mobile phone theft is so remote as to cause them not to record the serial number in the first place. If you irrationally believe that your mobile phone will not be stolen, penalizing you for a subsequently stolen phone is not a reasonable disincentive.</kw></p>
					<p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">The mobile phone industry itself is perhaps in the best position to push the registry, as they control the supply of phones. Retailers could incentivize recording the serial numbers by offering to keep a record on the customer's behalf, providing this service at the point of sale, and/or providing a financial incentive in the form of raising the price R100 and then offering a R100 discount or simply refusing to sell to customers who do not register their phone's serial numbers. What is the incentive for retailers to offer this service though? It seems phone retailers would in fact have a counterincentive, considering that phone theft will typically prompt a replacement purchase. And yet phone retailers in </kw><a target="_blank" class="wikipediaProfile" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_africa" rel="external"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">South Africa</kw></a><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3"> do in fact offer such a service. What could be driving this practice?</kw></p>
					<p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">I propose that such a solution is probably the result of some sort of intangible benefit being conferred on the service providers-positive public relations, or perhaps some collateral marketing benefit derived from promoting the program. It is important to note that vendors in </kw><a target="_blank" class="wikipediaProfile" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_africa" rel="external"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">South Africa</kw></a><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3"> most often sell airtime along with handsets; as such, the incentive to keep the customer regularly purchasing airtime may outweigh the profit from selling a replacement phone, especially when the purchase of a replacement phone in all likelihood leaves less money in the consumer's pocket to purchase airtime. Some of the benefit may of course be siphoned to other airtime vendors, but the overall benefits to the retailer of protecting the consumer's hardware investment may nevertheless be sufficient to explain the industry's practice of encouraging phone registry.</kw></p>
					<p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">At any rate, now that a solution is in place, hopefully we will see some decrease in the theft rate in </kw><a target="_blank" class="wikipediaProfile" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_africa" rel="external"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">South Africa</kw></a><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">. Of course there will always be some residual theft, but at least a robust phone registry system will help chip away at the overwhelming incentive inherent in a system where the limiting commodity is so portable and untraceable.</kw></p>
					<p class="subHeading"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-2">Mobile Phones as Technological Panacea</kw></p>
					<p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">Because mobile phones are emerging as the primary (and in most cases the only) technological artifact accessible to substantial segments of the population, they are taking on a significance in </kw><em><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">Southern Africa</kw></em><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3"> that may seem staggering to those who are used to having access to a whole panoply of technological devices to attend to specific needs. Services that U.S. inventors might never have dreamed up are being deployed in Africa as innovators are finding ways to make mobile phones fill unconventional technological needs precisely because they are the only devices available to do so.</kw></p>
					<p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">Of course we in the U.S. are accustomed to phones that can surf the internet, take pictures, and serve up ringtones. But these features often require specially-designed phones that are sold at a premium. What is amazing is to see the direction technology is heading in </kw><em><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">Southern Africa</kw></em><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">, toward expanding the functions available to phones equipped with nothing more than SMS technology. Farmers are now able to ascertain the going prices for produce despite being far from the market (LaFraniere 2005). Small merchants may now accept credit card payments via SMS (Vodacom 2005).</kw></p>
					<p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">For a couple of years now, South Africa's Vodacom has offered a service that allows users to give permission to be "found". This service triangulates a user's location based on the signal received from nearby mobile towers. Although nowhere near as precise as a GPS, this service is an innovative approach to determining location using the technology that is available. And of course, the technology is being carried a step further to perform a uniquely African function: researchers have been able to attach mobile phones to wildlife to track the movements of the animals (Ngowi 2005).</kw></p>
					<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.vodacom.com/" rel="external" class="ext_link"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">Vodacom</kw></a><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3"> also offers a number of SMS-based options aimed at keeping low-balance users talking. One such service is the "call me" feature, which allows a user to send a free SMS to another (presumably solvent) phone user asking the latter to call. In a regime where incoming calls are free, shifting the burden of payment in this manner and at no cost to the requesting party can be a critical factor in enabling two parties to continue to talk. Obviously it is in </kw><a target="_blank" href="http://www.vodacom.com/" rel="external" class="ext_link"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">Vodacom's</kw></a><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3"> best interest to offer this feature, especially in a market where massive numbers of users are prepaid and carry small balances. So of course </kw><a target="_blank" href="http://www.vodacom.com/" rel="external" class="ext_link"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">Vodacom</kw></a><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3"> doesn't stop there.</kw></p>
					<p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">There is also a "sponsor" feature that allows a user to volunteer up front to accept the charges for calls to specific numbers made by the beneficiary. Thus the functionality of the "call me" feature is expanded so that the low-balance user can communicate with people other than the person directly paying for the call. Take this a step further, and </kw><a target="_blank" href="http://www.vodacom.com/" rel="external" class="ext_link"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">Vodacom's</kw></a><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3"> airtime transfer option allows one party to transfer airtime outright to another with no restrictions whatsoever. Given the liquidity of the airtime market in Africa, it is entirely plausible to conceive of airtime itself as a sort of shadow currency (Ngowi 2005). In fact, it is a very short leap from there to a system that would allow the transfer of funds entirely via SMS. Such a system is already in place in </kw><a target="_blank" class="wikipediaProfile" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_africa" rel="external"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">South Africa</kw></a><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">.</kw></p>
					<p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">Perhaps the most amazing development to come out of the mobile phone revolution in Africa is the use of mobile tecnology to enhance and even supplant traditional banking. In parts of the world where huge segments of the population have never been able to take advantage of traditional banking operations, mobile phone technology is now providing the means to effect cash transfers. I mentioned above that Vodacom allows merchants to accept credit card payments and allows users to transfer balances between each other. </kw><a target="_blank" href="http://www.mtn.co.za/" rel="external" class="ext_link"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">MTN</kw></a><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">, another South African service provider, has essentially combined these two functions by enabling users to transfer cash (Itano 2005). Under this system, underlying banks process fund transfers initiated entirely through SMS messages, in much the same way as Paypal operates over email and the Internet.</kw></p>
					<p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">Given these amazing uses of mobile technology bred of necessity in </kw><em><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">Southern Africa</kw></em><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">, I would not be surprised if some of these innovations eventually make their way to more "developed" parts of the world. At the very least, these innovations should serve as a lesson about the importance of finding ingenious ways to accomplish tasks with whatever resources are available.</kw></p>
