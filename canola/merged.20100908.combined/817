<p></p>

<p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3"> Moral crusaders have the habit of heading off to their next crusade without 
  bothering to see whether anything went wrong on their last one. During the 80's, 
  TransAfrica, NAACP, Black Congressional Caucus, Hollywood glitterati, college 
  students, and other groups held massive protests on college campuses and at 
  the South African Embassy, built shanty towns and called for disinvestment and 
  sanctions against South Africa for its racist apartheid system.</kw></p>
<p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3"> There's no longer apartheid and there's black rule in South Africa but what's 
  the story there now? Andrew Kenny writes about it in his article, "Black People 
  Aren't Animals." The article appears in the British magazine </kw><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">The 
  Spectator</kw></span><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3"> (12/15/01), the world's oldest continuously published English 
  language magazine (est. 1838).</kw></p>
<p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3"> Each South African day sees an average of 59 murders, 145 rapes and 752 serious 
  assaults out of its 42 million population. The new crime is the rape of babies; 
  some AIDS-infected African men believe that having sex with a virgin is a cure. 
  Twelve percent of South Africa's population is HIV-positive but President Mbeki 
  says that HIV cannot cause AIDS. In response to growing violence, South Africa's 
  minister of safety and security, Steve Tshwete says, "We can't police this; 
  there's nothing more we can do. South Africa's currency, the rand, has fallen 
  about 70 percent since the African National Congress (ANC) came to power in 
  1994. Emigration from South Africa (mainly of skilled people) is now at its 
  highest level ever. </kw></p>
<p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3"> Mr. Kenny asks: "Is South Africa doomed to follow the rest of Africa into 
  oblivion?" He says no but I'm not as optimistic because of the pattern nearly 
  everywhere else in sub-Saharan Africa. The tragic fact of business is that ordinary 
  Africans were better off under colonialism. Colonial masters never committed 
  anything near the murder and genocide seen under black rule in Rwanda, Burundi, 
  Uganda, Nigeria, Mozambique, Somalia and other countries where millions of blacks 
  have been slaughtered in unspeakable ways that included: hacking to death, boiling 
  in oil, setting on fire and dismemberment. If as many elephants, zebras and 
  lions had been as ruthlessly slaughtered, the world's leftists would be in a 
  tizzy.</kw></p>
<p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3"> When Zimbabwe, then Southern Rhodesia, was under white rule, the ANC demanded 
  the ouster of Prime Minister Ian Smith and the installation of black rule. Today, 
  Zimbabwe's Minister Robert Mugabe commits gross violations of black and white 
  human rights. With the help of lawless thugs, Mugabe has undertaken a land confiscation 
  program from white farmers. Instead of condemning Zimbabwe human rights abuses, 
  the South African government has given Mugabe its unqualified support. </kw></p>
<p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3"> Andrew Kenny says that whites treat blacks like animals. When a dog misbehaves, 
  we don't blame the dog; we blame the owner for improper training. In Africa, 
  when blacks behave badly, Kenny says colonialism, imperialism, apartheid, globalization 
  or multi-nationalism is blamed for not bringing up blacks properly. Liberals 
  saw South Africa's, apartheid and other human rights abuses as unjust because 
  blacks were suffering at the hands of whites. They hold whites accountable to 
  civilized standards of behavior. Blacks are not held to civilized standards 
  of behavior. From the liberal's point of view it might even be racist to expect 
  blacks to adhere to civilized standards of behavior.</kw></p>
<p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3"> During South Africa's apartheid era, I visited several times and lectured 
  at just about every university. In a 1987 syndicated column I wrote: "Africa's 
  past experience should give western anti-apartheid activists some pause for 
  thought. Wouldn't it be the supreme tragedy if South African blacks might ponder 
  at some future date, like the animals of Jones' Manor, {George Orwell's Animal 
  Farm} whether they were better off under apartheid? That's why blacks must answer, 
  what's to come after apartheid? Black rule alone is no guarantee for black freedom."</kw></p>
