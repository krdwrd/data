                    inspiration for the prow decoration which were usually
                    bird or animal heads or animal and human figures. An
                    eye painted or applied on both sides of the prow not
                    only made the ship look like a fish but also was
                    thought to protect it from evil. As a duck moves it's

                     The ships of Santorini didn't sail in the open sea
                    but in shallow water and they used poles to move
                    foreword. Their long and narrow shape resembles the
                    dragon boats of China, the racing rowing boats and
                    skulls of the Thames, the canoes of the Nile, the
                    galleys of the Bosporus and the gondolas of Venice.
                    They are peacefully paraded on a festival day with the
                    flagship splendidly decorated. The passengers sit
                    facing one another as in the traditional Chinese lake
                    boats today. They are protected by straw awnings.
                    Straw is found naturally in abundance in China and
                    still used for tents on the river and lake boats.
                    Painted on the hull is are the symbolic decorations
                    for keeping evil away.</kw><br>

                     It seems certain that early river ships and
                    particularly the open sea ships used a compass in the
                    shape of a fish as did the ancient Chinese ships. Also
                    fish compasses were found on Cycladic Neolithic frying
                    pans and on Viking boats.</kw><br>
                    <br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
                     One of the numerous Chinese words to designate the
                    ship is the word 'ting'. The term 'you ting' means to
                    travel at sea in a light boat and this became the
                    international word for traveling in a pleasure boat:
                    yachting. The word 'lounch' is the name of a Chinese
                    war ship with wheels ('lunchaun' lun is wheel and
                    chaun is ship.) The popular Greek word 'Caiqi' means
                    colored flags in Chinese as boats were and still are
                    decorated in many colored flags.</kw><br>

                     Similar to the gondolas of Venice, small pleasure
                    boats sail in the canals of Sutzou, one of the ancient
                    capitals of China and with the similar architecture
                    both cities present the unique opportunity to become
                    sister cities.</kw></font><font face="Arial"><br>
