organized into three main groups based on their structure and technical 
parameters:  (1) multipurpose vessels with unlimited geographic range, 
(2) vessels with limited geographic range, and (3) regional or local 
coastal vessels.

Fleet of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Far East Branch, 
supports marine expeditions in the areas of oceanography, geophysics, biology,

is of interest to the Russian Academy of Sciences.  We lease our vessels and 
crews for research and exploitation of the ocean on a mutually beneficial 
basis.  The Fleet Administration invites all parties concerned with joint or 
independent research, organizing marine expeditions both in Russia and abroad, 
to consider our proposals to lease vessels and associated service while at 
sea and ashore.  We provide for the complete preparation of vessels and 
expeditions, including mounting and installation of all equipment and 
instruments.  We also provide for various marine guided tours around the 
waters of the Peter the Great, Ussuri and Amur bays, as well as around the 
islands, picturesque inlets, and the marine preserves of the greater 
Vladivostok region.
