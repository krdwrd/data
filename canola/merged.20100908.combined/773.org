                  <p class="bodyNormal"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">Golden Ocean, a London-based 
                    ship owner, was a good company with good ships, good charters, 
                    good financing relationships and an excellent track record 
                    of timing market cycles and repaying all financiers. The collapse 
                    and bankruptcy of Golden Ocean in 1998 was a prime example 
                    of where and how financial structures can go wrong. </kw><br>
                    <br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
                    Sadly, the US$300 million Golden Ocean high-yield bond deal 
                    - which led to the company's collapse - was doomed to fail 
                    primarily because of a lack of understanding between the company, 
                    its investment bankers and its bondholders. With hindsight, 
                    we should have achieved a better rating and raised money with 
                    secured bonds. Secured bonds on first-class cashflow streams 
                    would have shielded the bonds from the volatility of the short-term 
                    freight market. In other words, we should (and could) have 
                    refinanced our existing fleet of long-term chartered ships. 
                    So why didn't we do secured bonds? </kw><br>
                    <br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
                    At the time, it was a matter of having an offer proposed to 
                    me that seemed too good to refuse. An unsecured loan at 12 
                    percent? Unfortunately, I did not understand the high-yield 
                    bond market well enough to question it - and that was the 
                    beginning of the mistakes we made. 
                  </kw></p><p class="bodySubHead"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-2">The Ratings Game 
                  </kw></p><p><span class="bodyNormal"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3"> Our trouble worsened when we received 
                    a CCC rating from one of the rating agencies who didn't know 
                    or understand the shipping market. As a result, the interest 
                    rate increased from 12 percent to near 20 percent at the last 
                    minute - after all the expenses for the roadshow had been 
                    incurred. Then, our US investment banks, Sutra &amp; Co and Libra 
                    Investments, said that the bondholders required an option 
                    to have the company issue another US$100 million at the same 
                    pricing in six months' time - allowing for the fact that there 
                    was a clause restricting us from ordering more ships. </kw><br>
                    <br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
                    They told us it would be fairly easy to obtain a waiver on 
                    the restriction from ordering more ships so that we could 
                    afford the extra money on the back of more orders. When the 
                    time came, they forced the money on us but would not give 
                    a waiver on realistic terms. </kw><br>
                    <br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
                    With no choice, we asked legal counsel what to do and they 
                    came back with the idea of purchasing options on more new 
                    buildings, which according to them would be "bulletproof" 
                    within the bond indenture. </kw><br>
                    <br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
                    Of course, our legal counsel did not tell us beforehand what 
                    the bondholders' reaction would be - and that's when the trouble 
                    really started. When the Asia markets collapsed, it exacerbated 
                    a relationship already strained by misunderstanding. </kw><br>
                    <br>
                    </span><span class="bodySubHead"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-2">Rough Seas </kw></span><span class="bodyNormal"><br>
                    <br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
                    There was misunderstanding on the part of the bondholders 
                    who did not - and had no interest in - understanding the shipping 
                    business, and misunderstanding on our part on the whole principle 
                    of high-yield bonds. And there was misunderstanding of the 
                    real motives of the investors who purchased them. </kw><br>
                    <br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
                    Next, the bondholders used the newbuilding purchase option 
                    transactions recommended by our solicitors to drag Golden 
                    Ocean, which was still performing, into restructuring - in 
                    an effort to gain control of the equity in Golden Ocean. Unlike 
                    working with experienced banks/shipping financiers, who are 
                    gentle when a company is struggling, the high-yield investors 
                    were rough - investors changed every day, they thrived on 
                    misinformation, and they worked in small groups trying to 
                    cut side deals. Lawyers who thrive on protracted restructurings 
                    became involved in the process. </kw><br>

                    At this time, many of the new bond-holders specialized in 
                    buying bonds of companies below NAV and liquidating them for 
                    an immediate profit. </kw><br>

                    <br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
                    What Golden Ocean needed were the kind of investors who buy 
                    bonds and hold them. Instead our bonds were packaged and sold 
                    by a group of ex-Drexel Burnham people who made their living 
                    off of distressed companies. Ironically, while all of this 
                    self-created financial drama was occurring in New York, the 
                    company was running as usual. We took delivery of ships, chartered 
                    ships, financed ships, and did it all in a very difficult 
                    market. </kw><br>
                    <br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
                    In the end, I resigned from Golden Ocean and a new management 
                    took over. Again, even though the company was performing, 
                    the bondholders instructed the new management to auction the 
                    company through the Chapter 11 process. So why did I resign 
                    from a company that was my life's work? This brings me to 
                    one of the most significant and painful lessons of all. If 
                    you are the owner of a company you have to maintain daily 
                    involvement and absolute control - especially when it is under 
                    siege by this sort of creditor. I didn't, and by the time 
                    I realized what had happened, it was too late. </kw><br>
                    <br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
                    One of the most important lessons for me personally is that 
                    non-secured high-yield bonds are not about meeting financial 
                    obligations; they are about understanding the bond markets. 
                    </kw><br>
                    <br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
                    When the bonds were first issued, I thought of them as just 
                    another debt to be repaid. But unlike loans from traditional 
                    shipping financiers, these bonds are traded all the time. 
                    Although I knew this, I never thought through the consequences 
                    when the bonds were issued. More importantly, I never thought 
                    about the possibility of buying back the bonds at a discount 
                    myself. </kw><br>
                    <br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
                    The mistake was made on day one when I put all my eggs in 
                    one basket and put all my life's work into the same company 
                    that issued the bonds - leaving no significant assets to repurchase 
                    bonds. </kw><br>
                    <br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
                    Thereafter, a further mistake was to put additional shareholder 
                    loans into the company instead of buying bonds at a discount. 
                    The irony is that bondholders are actually happy when you 
                    are there to buy bonds back, even at a huge discount from 
                    the day they were issued. </kw><br>
                    <br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
                    They teach that the bond market, like any other market, goes 
                    through its own cycles when money is given away and when money 
                    needs to be retrieved. Therefore, theoretically one could 
                    take one's least attractive shipping assets in a good bond 
                    market (not necessarily a good shipping market) and issue 
                    bonds which one then buys back at 10 or 20 cents to the dollar, 
                    thereby getting "free" money to the tune of 80 or 90 cents. 
                    The irony is that not only is this allowed but bondholders 
                    are actually happy to be bought out when either they are tired 
                    of the business or when they need liquidity when their own 
                    markets turn south. </kw><br>
                    <br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
                    The most valuable question is this: could the US capital markets 
                    have been used successfully by Golden Ocean? And if the answer 
                    is yes. How? </kw><br>
                    <br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
                    In retrospect, a more appropriate structure would have led 
                    to a better rating. A better rating would have led to more 
                    reasonable pricing. More reasonable pricing would have appealed 
                    to investors with a longer view.</kw></span> <span class="bodyNormal">
