  seven countries of the region will be, basically, a curtain-raiser for several other big

  </b></font><font size="2"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">An intensive weekend at the Royal Varuna Yacht Club last week
  saw preparations for the forthcoming Asia-Pacific Laser Championships.</kw></font></p>
<font size="2">  </font><p align="left"><font size="2"><img src="s11.JPG" alt="s11.JPG (38848 bytes)" align="left" height="192" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="295"><em><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">Checking out the Royal Varuna Lasers for the big

<font size="2">  </font><p align="left"><font size="2"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">It also ushered in a very busy nautical period for the Kingdom in the last
  quarter of the year, with a number of national championships, the 1998 Royal Vega Rudder
  race dedicated to H.M. the King, the 13th Asiad yachting and water sports sections to be
  held at Pattaya-Jomtien and Sattahip from 6 - 19 December and the twelfth sailing of the
  Phuket King’s Cup regatta from 7 - 12 December.</kw></font></p>
<font size="2">  </font><p align="left"><font size="2"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">With the Asia-Pacifics opening a possibility for Thai sailors to
  participate in next January’s Laser Olympic pre-qualifying World Championships and
  several other huge regattas - also pre-Olympic qualifiers - already set for Melbourne in
  January, Thai sailors have a lot of competition ahead, leading up to Sydney 2000.</kw></font></p>
<font size="2">  </font><p align="left"><font size="2"><img src="s12.JPG" alt="s12.JPG (58899 bytes)" align="right" height="240" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="299"><em><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">Royal Varuna Commodore Lawnin Crawford goes down

<font size="2">  </font><p align="left"><font size="2"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">Royal Varuna Flag Commodore Lawnin Crawford, Varuna Laser fleet captain
  Charlie Zbinden and Cheerut Sudasna, MD of the Phatra Marine Products Company, the Laser
  distributor of Thailand, opened the Varuna racks for visiting Laser International officer
  Paul Millsom, arriving from Australia.</kw></font></p>
<font size="2">  </font><p align="left"><font size="2"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">Paul, as official measurer of this tightly-controlled class, spent a
  feverish two days grading the 60-some Varuna Lasers, assessing their conformity to a
  world-championship standard. Generally, for worlds and such big regional championships,
  new hulls are supplied from a licensed manufacturing source. However, tight budgets all
  around and a highly-punitive Thai tax structure levied upon any boats not exported after
  such an event, caused Laser International to look at the availability of local craft.</kw></font></p>
<font size="2">  </font><p align="left"><font size="2"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">Paul came away highly satisfied, noting that, with some adjustments, a few
  replacements and various other minor details, Royal Varuna had a Laser fleet worthy of
  this prestigious event.</kw></font></p>
<font size="2">  </font><p align="left"><font size="2"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">Adding that a pool of qualified international race officers and jurors is
  also available locally, Laser International expects a great regatta for this, one of the
  world’s most numerous one-design craft and, as of Atlanta (Savannah) in 1996, the
  newest Olympic single-handed class.</kw></font></p>
<font size="2">  </font><p align="left"><font size="2"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">Participants will descend on Pattaya from Australia, Guam, India, Japan,
  New Zealand, Singapore and, of course, there will be a large contingent of Thai sailors
  for the event, to be held from 31 October to 7 November.</kw></font></p>
<font size="2">  </font><p align="left"><font size="2"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">The 60 or more expected solo sailors will include some of the world’s
  best, such as Guam’s Brett Chivers and Aussie Michael Blackburn, who is one of the
  world’s top five. Blackburn, Australian national champion, was second-placed at the
  International Sailing Federation’s (ISAF) worlds at Dubai earlier this year and was
  fourth at the Atlanta Olympiad.</kw></font></p>
<font size="2">  </font><p align="left"><font size="2"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">One of the many things that delight sailors coming to Royal Varuna at
  South Pattaya is the availability of good accommodation only 300 metres walking-distance
  from the venue, and then a soft-sand beach launch to a start line only a few minutes
  offshore. This combination is, indeed, rare - at any event.</kw></font></p>
<font size="2">  </font><p align="left"><font size="2"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">What a contrast to the horrendous accommodation and race-course distances
  from the venue and the apparent transport problems at Atlanta, to look at one example.</kw></font></p>
<font size="2">  </font><p align="left"><font size="2"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">One can only hope that the hotels in this area will clean up their mess
  before the event, so competitors will not have to wade through stinking raw sewerage being
  released onto the access road from some of these hotels - for so many months now, that
  parts of the road have been destroyed.</kw></font></p>
<font size="2">  </font><p align="left"><font size="2"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">It could be a lasting impression of "Amazing Thailand" for these
  visiting sailors - many coming from high levels of management and public office in their
  own lands - negating somewhat the many positive images that the Asia-Pacific regatta will
  impart.</kw></font></p>
<font size="2">  </font><p align="left"><font size="2"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">The culprits were warned at Pattaya City Hall last week in a meeting
  between the City Fathers and a visiting contingent of members of the Foreign
  Correspondents Club of Thailand. The regatta organizers hope the hoteliers will respond.</kw></font></p>
<font size="2">  </font><p align="left"><font size="2"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">Paul Millsom noted that the top three placings among both the Asian groups
  and the Oceanic teams (Aust, N.Z.) will automatically pre-qualify for slots at the Laser
  World Championships to be held on Port Phillip, Melbourne, early in January and,
  consequently, a chance for the Olympics.</kw></font></p>
<font size="2">  </font><p align="left"><font size="2"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">In fact, with the world’s huge yachting fraternity concentrating
  already on the Sydney 2000 Olympics, many prior events, including Thailand’s own
  Laser-Pacifics, will have some bearing on the first Olympiad of the new millennium.</kw></font></p>
<font size="2">  </font><p align="left"><font size="2"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">Paul noted that there will be a 1999 World Sailing Championships held at
  Melbourne, which is mooted "as one of the largest international yachting events ever
  staged". The Victorian Yachting Council, the organizing body, "has secured the
  rights to host the first concurrent conduct of 15 world championships, seven of which
  (will be) a qualifier for Sydney 2000."</kw></font></p>
<font size="2">  </font><p align="left"><font size="2"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">All this will take place on Port Phillip during January. It will be an
  incredible array of racing - at least 2,000 racing craft plus jury boats, committee
  vessels, rescue craft, police patrols and a huge spectator fleet spread across Port
  Phillip during the period.</kw></font></p>
<font size="2">  </font><p align="left"><font size="2"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">As Paul said, "we have run out of international judges but Port
  Phillip’s massive open waterway, covering almost 2,000 square km (about half the size
  of Brunei Darassalam) of deep water will ensure plenty of room at the marks for all
  classes."</kw></font></p>
<font size="2">  </font><p align="left"><font size="2"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">The seven classes, which will have Olympic qualifiers, include the new
  Olympic design 49er, Soling, Finn, 470 men, 470 women, Europe (women) and the Laser.</kw></font></p>
<font size="2">  </font><p align="left"><font size="2"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">May the forthcoming Laser event witness a Thai sailor qualifying for the
  Melbourne event - and then, on to the Olympics! Maybe Thailand’s first Olympic
  yachting Gold is in the offing.</kw></font></p>

  Harry Riley, 3 down</kw></font></p>
<font size="2">  </font><p align="left"><font size="2"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">Norman Brooks took a respite from the rigors of being retired in Pattaya
  and went back to his native Wales for a two month vacation. He came back well rested and
  relaxed and ready to resume playing golf with The Alternative Golf Gentlemen’s
  Society. It took him a week to get into the swing of things, but on Wednesday Norman was
  ready. He won the bogey competition at Phoenix finishing his match play "all
  square".</kw></font></p>
<font size="2">  </font><p align="left"><font size="2"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">It must have rained the whole time he was back in the U.K. because the
  heavy rain at Phoenix didn’t seem to bother him much. While the rest of the field
  struggled with wet grips, stinging eyes, and soggy lies, Norman just kept his cool and
  never let his match get away.</kw></font></p>
<font size="2">  </font><p align="left"><font size="2"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">Playing off 16, Norman shot a one under par 87 and won not only the
  competition, but four "squat boxes" and eight skins from his fellow golfers.
  Later at the Hare House, enjoying the fruits of those who couldn’t get their drives
  past the ladies’ tees, Norman was asked to what he attributed his fine round under
  such adverse conditions. "Inferior competition," cracked one of the back
  benchers. Norman just smiled and took another sip from one his free Heinekens.</kw></font></p>
<font size="2">  </font><p align="left"><font size="2"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">Coming in second and just one down in his match against the course was
  American Mike Morris who was making his first appearance on the leader board. Playing off
  10, Mike shot a gross 83.</kw></font></p>
<font size="2">  </font><p align="left"><font size="2"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">Tying for third place at 3 down were Harry Riley and Roger Errington.</kw></font><b><font face="Arial" size="3"></font></b></p>

  2nd (tie): B.J. Smith, 36 points</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">
  Malcolm Clare, 36 points</kw></font></p>
<font size="2">  </font><p align="left"><font size="2"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">When a golfer scores 41 Stableford points in competition, the eyebrows go
  up, the smirk spreads across the face, and the question is asked; "What is his
  handicap?" Expecting the answer to be twenty-five plus, the mouth drops open when the
  reply is "ten’. Mike Morris won his first TAGGS tournament with an impressive 41
  Stableford points at Natural Park Resort on Friday and became the fourteenth straight
  different singles winner in competitions out of the Hare House.</kw></font></p>
<font size="2">  </font><p align="left"><font size="2"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">The ten handicapper overcame the NO CARTS TODAY ruling that was posted in
  the lobby of the club house and walked his way to the top of the leader board. He also had
  to overcome the rain softened fairways from the previous night’s drenching and the
  strong winds that blew all day. In spite of the rain, the course was in good shape but the
  golfers used to playing "cart ball" were not. There were some weary looking
  farangs in the locker room after the day’s round.</kw></font></p>
<font size="2">  </font><p align="left"><font size="2"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">Holding up to the rigors of a "good walk spoiled" was Australian
  B. J. Smith who made his first appearance on the rostrum as he accepted his designer golf
  shirt from Hare House emcee Richard Livingston. B. J. had thirty six points and tied for
  second with red hot Malcolm Clare who seems to like the attention that comes from doing
  well in golf tournaments.</kw></font></p>

  <font size="2"></font><p align="left"><font size="2"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">Pattaya’s trivial pursuits addicts, as and when sober,
  are being asked to note the administrative changes to both the Sunday and Wednesday
  leagues. Following the resignation of Sunday question setter Roger Harris, who has left
  Thailand for a university appointment in UK, both quizzes are now set by Barrie Kenyon who
  is generally regarded as both overworked and undervalued. Not to mention underpaid.</kw></font></p>
<font size="2">  </font><p align="left"><font size="2"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">Questions will no longer be delivered to individual bars, nor will the
  answer sheets be collected. Instead, home bar owners will collect the envelopes from
  Palmer’s Bar, in Pattayland Soi 2, anytime after 3 p.m. on the day of the quiz.
  Answer sheets must be returned to Palmer’s no later than 9 p.m. on the following day.
  Palmer’s has arranged for a drawer, ingeniously marked quiz, to be used for these
  purposes.</kw></font></p>
<font size="2">  </font><p align="left"><font size="2"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">Results sheets will be placed in the following week’s question
  envelopes. There are no changes to the appeals framework and alternative answers to those
  on the master answer sheet will be allowed where appropriate. Where the answer on the
  master sheet turns out to be plainly and obviously wrong, which happens whenever Barrie
  has an attack of senile dementia, then bars following him with the same silly answer will
  have marks deducted. In the past, mistakes by the question setters generally resulted in
  the cancellation of the question, that is all bars received two points willy nilly. This
  over generous concession has now been withdrawn lest Pattaya’s reputation as a center
  of deep learning and amazing insight be compromised.</kw></font></p>

<font size="2">  </font><p align="left"><font size="2"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">Eighteen Canadian arthritis patients took part in a six-week program of
  Aerobics, Stretching and Power training. They faired a lot better than twenty other

  Patients who worked out were able to reduce their pain by about one third, those who

<font size="2">  </font><p align="left"><font size="2"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">Having had no prior workout history, most patients experienced increased
  pain during the first week of training (non-arthritic trainers should get the same

  young to be able to withstand some of the bone density loss that occurs later in life,
  after menopause. Frequent bone fractures in older women is a great and costly health risk.
  A risk that is compounded by a sedentary lifestyle but can be controlled by regular
  exercise (and a calcium rich diet will help a lot in the fight).</kw></font></p>
