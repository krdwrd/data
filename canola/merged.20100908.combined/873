          three or four years. And if you think about it, we've been able to deliver 
          a certain amount of housing. The country has made a stable economic 
          transition. There has been a lot of rule making and rule changing. So 
          it's been a pretty much successful transition in that respect. But there's 
          still a lot of work to be done, especially in the economic arena. </kw></p>
        <p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3"> MARGARET WARNER: Would you say that politically and economically they 
          should run different tracks so that there's been more progress maybe 
          politically than economically? </kw></p>
        <p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3"> XOLELA MANGCU: There's definitely been more progress politically and, 
          I might add, culturally. I mean, there's a certain sense of self-assertion. 
          There's a tremendous amount of self-confidence amongst black people 
          in South Africa. Economically, people are beginning to consolidate some 
          of the gains of the past. In one of the meetings we had with the business 
          leaders, some of the leading business people in the black economic empowerment 
          movement, we got a sense that does there's this consolidation. </kw></p>
        <p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3"> MARGARET WARNER: Mr. Chettle, what's your take on this, how well they're 
          making--how completely or how far along they are in this transition? 
        </kw></p>

          CHETTLE: I think they're remarkably far. You know, one of the things 
          that we really don't take enough account of is just how much has been 
          achieved, and largely I think because when the transition took place, 
          both apartheid and the Marxist-Leninist philosophy of the ANC Communist 
          Party of South Africa had been exhausted. And they both had to look 
          for something new, and I mean, one of the things that's quite remarkable 
          is not just the peacefulness of the transition, and how well it has 
          gone, and how much reconciliation, genuine reconciliation there has 
          been, but also how much the government has embraced what can only be 
          called a free market philosophy. I mean, just this week it was announced

          their expectations have not been meant. So there's a long way to go,

          all due respect to Prof. Brutus, whom I hold in very high regard, and 
          I've always followed him from afar, it's been three years, it's been 
          three or four years, and it's too soon to expect a lot of the economic 
          and service delivery changes to have taken place. What needs to be done, 
          what has been done very successfully in the past few years is setting 
          in place the institutional environment for those delivery mechanisms 
          to come to fruition. </kw></p>

          you know. You have to appropriate for the budget system. And so there's 
          a certain process that is involved in getting things approved. Now, 
          in terms of the free market participation of black people that's true. 
          I mean, black people have not been able to participate in the free market 
          system that's being embraced by the government. </kw></p>
        <p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3"> MARGARET WARNER: And why is that? </kw></p>
        <p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3"> XOLELA MANGCU: Because there's a skills gap. Because there's a legacy 
          that we're dealing with, and government will have to have an active 
          role. We can't just leave it to the free market. It has to be a partnership, 
          a partnership between government, business, and civil society organizations. 
          And that's why the president's visit actually could have a tremendous 
          amount of influence. </kw></p>
        <p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3"> MARGARET WARNER: Is that right, Mr. Chettle, but there's a big skills

          JOHN CHETTLE: There is a big skills gap, and the statistics show that 
          of the developed countries--and of course, South Africa isn't really 
          a properly developed country, but it's pretty near the bottom, both 
          educationally and in science as well. But-- </kw></p>
        <p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3"> MARGARET WARNER: And that's because under apartheid, really blacks 
          were not educated. </kw></p>
        <p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3"> JOHN CHETTLE: I know. You had a huge educational gap. But over and 
          above that, of course, Mr. Brutus is quite right, something like 50 
          percent of poor people don't have jobs. And when you think that in the 
          worst years of the Depression in this country the unemployment rate 
          was 25 percent, now we're talking about something closer to twice that, 
          the pressures that that puts on ordinary people and on the government 
          to find some ways of dealing with that are enormous. And so some ways 
          are going to have to be found to find a solution to that. And quite 
          clearly nobody's very clear as to what can be done, other than there 
          should be as much new investment as possible, that a climate--country--that 
          there should be as little regulation that increases the costs of jobs 
          and so on. </kw></p>

          now sitting on the boards of corporations and benefiting from a very 
          affluent quality of life. But unfortunately, this is for a very small

        <p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3"> XOLELA MANGCU: That's true, and that has certainly been the case, 
          for example, in the United States following desegregation. And the challenge 
          really for the government is to develop public policies, and this is 
          where, again, President Clinton's visit becomes very important. What 
          can we learn from some of the job initiatives in the United States? 
          What can we learn from other places in the world for that matter about 
          how you connect the main people in main street to the mainstream economy? 
          And that is a </kw><img src="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/images/africa/jan-june98/saf6.gif" alt="South Africa's Future" align="left" width="145" height="97"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">great 
          challenge. And, you know, following the conversations we had with business 
          people, that is sort of the next step. But the consolidation, itself--I 
          mean, people have been sitting on boards for a long time, and some of 
          them were really token appointments to these boards, but now there's 
          a greater sense of self-assertion, as I said earlier on. People over 
          the past four years started to grasp some of the skills of managing 
          those companies. So the next step in black economic empowerment actually 
          is a whole question of how do you operationalize economic development, 
          black economic development beyond just the access of a few business 
          people, how do you develop those linkages, and that's a practical question 
          that we have to grapple with as a society. </kw></p>

          but to the rest of Africa. Trade which benefits the corporations, the 
          multinationals, but not the people--Congressman Jesse Jackson has been 
          very critical, so has Randall Robinson, and both of them have said that 
          these are opportunities for the corporations to increase their profits. 
          But these are not opportunities to improve conditions for people either 
          in Africa or in South Africa. And that, I think, is the most troubling 
          aspect.

          to that. The deputy president Mbeki--in fact--said that to some degree 
          in a radio interview that was reported today in South Africa, where 
          he said that the administration's new--you know, shall we trade not 
          aid--he said that's wrong. Is there something to that? Is this administration 
          and this Congress in danger of overemphasizing trade? </kw></p>
        <p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3"> JOHN CHETTLE: No, I don't think it is, because if you think about

          consists of, we're talking about 600 million dollars over three years. 
          That's not an awful lot of money. Trade is potentially much greater 
          than that and can lead to much greater results. What we have really 
          is a philosophical difference of opinion. I mean, there is what you 
          may call the European model, which essentially has provided 11, 12, 
          13 percent unemployment, a high degree of regulation, relatively little 
          in the way of new jobs over a long period of time, and you have the 
          American model, which is a much more laissez-faire, free market model, 
          which over the last 18 years has produced something like 40 million 
          new jobs. Now, there are still big problems in this country, there's 
          still a lot of poverty in this country, but if you have to compare the 
          results, it seems to me there's no doubt which South Africa ought to 
          follow. </kw></p>

          the world, so that we can--of our people and our institutions--so globalization 
          is--has very--a lot of problems go with it, but there are also some 
          opportunities that we can take advantage of in developing not a European

          privatization, I think the prospects are that things are going to get 
          worse both in South Africa and in continent of Africa and our chances 
          of developing an African alternative either to the western model or 
          to the American model I think the chances are not very good. We can
