            <p class="BodyCopy"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">Mackphie Elisha works for Tyson Foods in Springdale. 
              He doesn’t make a fortune but has achieved his goal of sending 
              his two children to public school. Elisha looks forlorn when he 
              talks about his homeland. He misses it. But he says he will not 
              return until his children have earned their diplomas. He thinks 
              an education will give them opportunities he never had, but he worries 
              that they will lose their Marshallese culture along the way.</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
              Benny Luke lives on Majuro, capital of the Marshall Islands and 
              some 6,000 miles from Springdale. He has not left his homeland, 
              and when told of Elisha’s dilemma, he simply smiles. “That’s 
              our problem over here, too,” Luke said, sitting in the courtyard 
              of his family home. Baby chickens trot by and his daughter fans 
              the flames under a kettle cooking dinner. “We worry these Marshallese 
              kids will lose their identity because of all these influences from 
              without.”</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
              The Marshall Islands are known as an easygoing place, where people 
              live by “island time” and let the days pass luxuriously 
              slowly. But the culture is changing rapidly. Ancient traditions 
              are eroding with the arrivals of barges carrying consumer goods, 
              building materials and automobiles.</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
              The origin of the Marshallese is unknown, although their language 
              resembles those of Southeast Asia. Before Europeans arrived, the 
              Marshallese language was oral only. There are no written clues about 
              the islanders’ early culture.</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
              The Marshallese way of life was first interrupted in the 1520s, 
              when Spanish explorers arrived. The islands remained under varying 
              degrees of Spanish control for several centuries but were named 
              for the British captain William Marshall, who visited in 1788. The 
              British, though, never established a colony on the islands.</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
              Germany bought the islands from Spain in 1885 and was the first 
              foreign power to turn a profit from the meager resources available. 
              The Germans organized a network of trading posts to collect copra, 
              dried coconut meat that is crushed to make coconut oil. Producing 
              copra remains the dominant industry on remote outer islands that 
              have little infrastructure.</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
              The Marshall Islands consist of dozens of atolls, widespread chains 
              of slender islands and islets that surround shallow lagoons. </kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
              Over the years the Europeans built churches and sent missionaries 
              who converted many islanders to Christianity. The religion took 
              root. On the urban islands of Ebeye and Majuro, the churches are 
              full on Sundays, and singing reverberates in the streets. In Springdale, 
              there are at least 11 Marshallese congregations. Most are Protestant, 
              often Assembly of God. The minority of islanders in the city who 
              are Roman Catholic say they attend local churches with congregations 
              of mixed backgrounds.</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
              Japan took over the islands during World War I and ruled them as 
              a colony for the next 30 years. As the Marshallese hopscotched from 
              the rule of one power to another, their way of life gradually transformed. 
              The remote location of the islands, the great distances between 
              them and their scant economic value kept the pace of modernization 
              slow. </kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
              No country changed the islands as much, or as quickly, as did the 
              United States. U.S. soldiers wrested the islands from Japan in World 
              War II. The U.S. government took control and administered the islands 
              as a trust territory on behalf of the United Nations. American taxpayers 
              have pumped more than $1 billion into the islands since 1986, according 
              to The World Factbook compiled by the Central Intelligence Agency. 
              The flow of money began after World War II. </kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
              Perhaps the most publicized effect of the U.S. presence has been 
              the fallout from testing nuclear bombs on islands in the northwest 
              corner of the nation. Former residents of those islands still live 
              in exile. The Bikini atoll remains uninhabited, and nearby Rongelap 
              atoll is nearly so. The atolls’ soil is contaminated with radiation.</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
              But the nuclear testing tends to overshadow the larger force of 
              change at work in the Marshall Islands, said Robert Kiste, an anthropologist 
              who has studied the islands for 40 years. Dollars from the U.S. 
              Treasury have done more to change the people and their culture than 
              the radiation from U.S. bombs, Kiste said. “The people affected 
              by the radiation are in the minority,” Kiste said. “The 
              communities that are affected are smaller places.”</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
              In contrast, money spent by the U.S. government on densely populated 
              islands like Ebeye and Majuro has affected every island in the nation. 
              The course of these changes could be drawn as a path on a map. At 
              one end of the path is Mackphie Elisha in Springdale. In the middle 
              is Benny Luke’s crowded neighborhood and others like it on 
              Majuro. Finally, the path ends at remote atolls like Arno.</kw></p>
            <p class="BodyCopy"><b><kw class="krdwrd-tag-2">LILIES AND ALAPS</kw></b><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
              Arno actually gets dark after nightfall. There are no streetlights, 
              no lighted signs, no rushing cars to keep the darkness at bay. A 
              couple of hours after sunset, it is difficult to see a few feet 
              down the road as teenagers and others take their nightly walks called 
              “jambos.” People emerge in the glow of a flashlight beam 
              and then disappear into the night.</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
              Arno has no power plant, no sewer system and no paved streets. The 
              principal road on the main island, also called Arno, is a pitted 
              strip of bare earth baked gray by the sun. It meanders through a 
              lush green jungle where towering breadfruit trees and coconut palms 
              keep the air cool in their shade. After a rainy morning in September, 
              a large mother pig wallows in a fresh puddle in the middle of the 
              road while half a dozen piglets vie to suckle from her. </kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
              Islands like this are the last bastion of Marshallese culture.</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
              The 2,000 or so residents of Arno atoll live on traditional family 
              properties called “wetos.” A weto is a strip of land that 
              runs from one side of the narrow island to the other. Families living 
              on a weto have the right to build homes and collect fruit, but they 
              do not own the land. All land is owned by the “iroij,” 
              the equivalent of a tribal king or chief. </kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
              Between the commoners and the chief there is a man like Biti Lake, 
              who is an “alap.” The alap is a middle manager, someone 
              who takes complaints and requests from the people while enforcing 
              the edicts of the iroij.</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
              Lake was born in 1938 and received the title of alap through inheritance. 
              He said most of his work involves property disputes that he must 
              settle for the iroij. When it comes to border fights, Lake has seen 
              it all.</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
              The property lines of a weto are often demarcated with rows of white 
              lilies. Lake has seen old men dig the lilies up at night and replant 
              them elsewhere, usually changing the border to include a well on 
              their land. But it’s tough to fool the alap. Lake said a dead 
              giveaway is a row of young plants placed where lilies used to be. 
              </kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
              An alap doesn’t usually work the land. But Lake recently used 
              a machete to clear away underbrush on his family’s plot. With 
              a white towel wrapped around his forehead to keep sweat from his 
              eyes, Lake wandered over the property and collected coconuts, throwing 
              them into a pile to be husked.</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
              He seemed to enjoy the labor, but Lake wasn’t doing it for 
              fun. Over the past few decades, Arno’s population has dwindled 
              as residents left for Majuro or Arkansas, he said.</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
              “It’s been good for those people, but it’s been bad 
              for the land,” he said. “Thirty years ago, there were 
              a lot of people. There were more crops, more plantings, more people 
              helping each other.” To an American visitor, it might seem 
              perplexing that people would leave the green jungles, pristine white 
              beaches and sparkling blue lagoon of Arno.</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
              The Marshallese generally agree that there are two forces motivating 
              residents to leave the outer islands. The forces work in concert 
              as a sort of “carrot and stick.” The carrot is the lure 
              of the modern world — cold drinks, television shows and automobiles 
              on Majuro or in the United States. The stick is the hardship and 
              boredom that can accompany life on outer islands, where populations 
              once were kept in check by limited food instead of by migration. 
              </kw><br>
              <img src="trad2.gif" alt="Collecting copra" name="trad2" align="left" border="0" height="250" hspace="5" vspace="5" width="180"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">Both 
              forces are at play in the home of Fredly Relvho. He lives just off 
              the main road in Arno with his wife and five children. They share 
              a single room, roughly 12 feet square, with a concrete floor and 
              cinder-block walls. They sleep on mats of woven leaves no thicker 
              than a denim jacket. </kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
              Relvho said his father and sister live in Springdale. Many of his 
              neighbors have moved there, as well. For him, that means there are 
              fewer people left to help him with the chores. “My father told 
              me: ‘You must stay here and take care of the land,’” 
              Relvho said. “It’s really hard for me. They leave, and 
              I don’t have anything.”</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
              To earn cash, Relvho makes copra, a laborious job that requires 
              collecting coconuts in the jungle and then husking, splitting, cooking 
              and bagging them. It can take two days to make a bag of copra that’s 
              worth $10 to $12.</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
              At the end of a hard day’s work, Relvho and his family can 
              sit back, relax and watch how the rest of the world lives. In a 
              corner of their home a small television and VCR sit on a wobbly 
              wooden table, next to a box of videocassettes. The devices are hooked 
              up to a gasoline-powered generator. </kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
              One to three nights a week, Relvho said, his family gathers around 
              as he fires up the generator. One gallon of diesel will run the 
              television for two hours. Among his favorite movies are the Martin 
              Lawrence action flick Bad Boys and the shark thriller Jaws II.</kw></p>
            <p class="BodyCopy"><b><kw class="krdwrd-tag-2">DEUCES WILD</kw></b><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
              Most Marshallese go to Majuro or Ebeye when they leave the outer 
              islands, joining family members who already have jobs. On Ebeye, 
              houses get so crowded that there’s not enough floor space to 
              accommodate everyone at night. Some families sleep in shifts.</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
              Although living conditions are far different from those on Arno, 
              many aspects of Marshallese culture remain. Ebeye and Majuro are 
              still divided into wetos, which are still run by alaps and iroij. 
              </kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
              On Ebeye, the iroij still have the power to evict residents from 
              the land, making the kings more powerful in many ways than the municipal 
              government. The iroij who own Ebeye require that women on the island 
              wear long dresses instead of pants or skirts, hewing to Marshallese 
              tradition.</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
              But the shifting culture can be seen in groups of children who roam 
              the alleyways of Ebeye at night. When hailed by an outsider with 
              the Marshallese greeting of “yokwe,” the children usually 
              respond eagerly in English, crying, “Hello” or “What’s 
              up, man?”</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
              Many of the children essentially raise themselves while their parents 
              work long hours, said Rose Bobo, director of mental health services 
              at the Ebeye hospital.</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
              “It’s hard for them growing up here. They are trying hard 
              to change as we expect them to, but at the same time we are trying 
              to keep them Marshallese,” Bobo said. “Kids go through 
              a lot of changes these days. We expect a lot of them: to go to school, 
              to get a job. And their grandparents aren’t there to give them 
              advice.”</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
              Late one Sunday night, some teenage boys sat along a sidewalk on 
              Ebeye, suspiciously eyeing pedestrians on the street. A few feet 
              away, one of their friends stood at a corner with a stick in his 
              hand, anxiously gazing down a dark alleyway. The boys were on the 
              lookout for rival gang members, said their friend, 20-year-old Linber 
              Anej.</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
              The “gangs” on Ebeye are not organized around illegal 
              activity or drug dealing in the way many U.S. gangs are. They are 
              more like neighborhood groups that kids join to gain a sense of 
              identity, Anej said. </kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
              “If they see a movie that’s like gangsters, they’ll 
              do that,” Anej said. “They want to be a hero.” He 
              said a favorite movie on Ebeye is </kw><i><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">Deuces Wild</kw></i><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">, which features 
              big gangs fighting with sticks and chains. Scenes like that give 
              kids on Ebeye a sense of excitement and purpose, Anej said. Teenage 
              gang members occasionally break into fights using rocks and boards 
              as weapons, according to Anej and others. Guns are banned on Ebeye.</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
              Thelma Jack wanted something different for her son Nikko, so they 
              moved from Ebeye to the United States with her husband, an American 
              who had been employed at the Army base on Kwajalein. Nikko Jack 
              now is 22 and lives in Springdale. He works at factory jobs and 
              plays music at a Marshallese</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
              nightclub in Springdale.</kw><br>
              <img src="trad3.gif" alt="Rocks or bottle tops as game pieces." name="trad3" align="right" border="0" height="250" hspace="5" vspace="5" width="180"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">Like 
              most Marshallese in Arkansas, he says it’s unlikely he will 
              move back to the islands. But he hasn’t abandoned his culture 
              altogether. He still speaks Marshallese at home and loves Springdale 
              because he can be among other Marshallese. </kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
              The nightclub where he plays is a former Hispanic bar that until 
              recently had advertisements in Spanish painted on the window. On 
              a typical night, 150 Marshallese visit the club and dance to music 
              from their homeland. Like their peers on Ebeye, many wear trendy 
              American clothes. Nikko Jack seemed puzzled when asked if the alaps 
              and iroij had any power in Springdale, where tribal land rights 
              have been replaced with leases and mortgages. He recommended asking 
              an “old” person about the matter.</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
              “I don’t really know about the system,” he said.</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
              Marshallese parents in Springdale say it’s tough to raise their 
              kids according to their native custom amid theAmerican influence. 
              But it’s obvious they are trying. Ninety-eight percent of the 
              Marshallese in Arkansas speak their native language at home — 
              the same proportion as families on the islands, according to a U.S. 
              Census survey.</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
              Families keep other trappings of their culture alive, as well.</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
              In early December, Marshallese church groups began practicing for 
              the coming Christmas celebration. Just like their relatives back 
              on Majuro, they gathered every night to practice dances and songs 
              that were to be performed at big church gatherings on Christmas 
              Day.</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
              On a bone-chilling night in mid-December, a few minivans were parked 
              in front of a house on Parker Avenue in downtown Springdale. Inside, 
              the front living room was virtually bare, except for couches pushed 
              against the walls. As the evening progressed, Marshallese neighbors 
              and friends arrived to practice for the Christmas performance. By 
              9 p.m., there were 12 dancers standing in three rows in the middle 
              of the room, moving to the rapid beat of a synthesizer keyboard. 
              </kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
              The group practiced an old dance from the islands as the men sang 
              a song about a crab that steals food from a campsite. The dancers 
              got down on all fours, planting their arms on the carpet and kicking 
              their legs around like skittering crabs. Two old men laughed as 
              they sang along.</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
              The children practiced a new dance, this one about their new homeland. 
              They held their arms out and bobbed as if they were riding horses. 
              Then they turned and formed six-shooters with their hands, firing 
              right, then left. Finally they wheeled their arms over their heads 
              as if they held lassos, and cried: “Yeehaw, Yeehaw,” in 
              time with the music.</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
              This new song is “The Cowboy.”</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
              Many of these youngsters may never see the islands. Adult islanders 
              like Nikko Jack often are evasive about returning home. “Time 
              will tell,” he says. “You don’t know when you’re 
              going to go back.” </kw></p>
