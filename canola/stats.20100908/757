What are drinking games and what's the point? When I was in college, we drank, but we didn't play games. We just drank. Why are students playing "games" these days? Doesn't it seem kind of childish? I don't mind my son drinking but I wonder if it could get out of hand if they all think it's a big game.</kw></em></p><p><em><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1-60">Sincerely,</kw></em></p><p><em><kw class="krdwrd-tag-mrgtie-40">Drinking Isn't a Game</kw></em></p><p></p><p><span class="bluehead"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1-90">A:</kw></span> </p><p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-mrgtie-40">Dear Drinking Isn't a Game,</kw></p><p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">Lots of parents are concerned about their children playing drinking games while away at college. It is a good idea if you talk to your child about drinking and games while they are still young, as many kids begin </kw><a href="http://www.askapril.com/articles_whats_a_few_beers-9-1.htm" target="_blank"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-90">drinking in high school and even younger</kw></a><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">. But it's never too late to talk to your kids about drinking!</kw></p><span class="pink"><strong><kw class="krdwrd-tag-2-90">Why people play drinking&nbsp;games:</kw></strong></span>&nbsp; <p><strong><kw class="krdwrd-tag-mrgtie-40">* Drinking games are a baby step toward intimacy, rather than a giant leap toward it.</kw></strong> </p><p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">Drinking games are popular because they connect people who are drinking, and therefore, letting down their resources, and wanting to connect. Drinking games give people who are drinking a common reason to interact without getting personal, which can be threatening to some people. Drinking games are a much easier way for men and women to interact without going straight to come-ons and "lines." It's almost like a group date that many younger people choose when they first start dating because the intimacy of one on one contact is too much stimulation for them and/or too scary. </kw></p><p class="pink"><strong><kw class="krdwrd-tag-2-90">The scary part about drinking games:</kw></strong></p><p><strong><kw class="krdwrd-tag-mrgtie-40">* Drinking games can mask </kw><a href="http://www.askapril.com/blogs/april/03-07-2007-behavior-poor-party-animals/" target="_blank"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1-40">problem drinking</kw></a><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1-60">.</kw></strong> </p><p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">For people who routinely drink too much, drinking games are an excuse to drink. People drinking and playing drinking games can tell themselves that they're playing the games first -- and drinking second. They can also conveniently loose count of how many drinks they have because the game takes the focus away from the drink count. They can also blame drinking a lot on the game rather than on their desire to get wasted. </kw></p><p><strong><kw class="krdwrd-tag-mrgtie-40">*Drinking games initiate new drinkers.</kw></strong> </p><p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">Drinking games are an introduction to drinking for young people who are unfamiliar with drinking. They figure that if there's a game involved, it must be a youth oriented activity because most mature adults their parents' ages don't play these games. The game part of the drinking games dilutes the possible danger of drinking for young people. </kw></p><p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-90">Make sure you </kw><a href="http://www.askapril.com/blogs/april/12-19-2006-college-drinking-education-needed/" target="_blank"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-90">talk to your child about drinking</kw></a><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-90"> and why people play drinking games. These games may be harmless but people need to&nbsp;understand that they are games for adults and can be masking deeper problems.</kw></p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="font-style: italic;"><a href="http://www.askapril.com" title="Dating Tips and advice from April Masini"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-mrgtie-40">April Masini</kw></a><kw class="krdwrd-tag-mrgtie-40"> -- nicknamed "the new millennium's Dear Abby" by the media, is author of the best-selling books </kw><a href="http://www.askapril.com/date-out-of-your-league-reviews.php" title="Dating Book - Date Out Of Your League"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-mrgtie-40">Date Out Of Your League</kw></a><kw class="krdwrd-tag-mrgtie-40"> and </kw><a href="http://www.askapril.com/think-date-like-a-man-reviews.php" title="Dating Book - Think &amp; Date Like A Man"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-mrgtie-40">Think &amp; Date Like A Man</kw></a><kw class="krdwrd-tag-mrgtie-40">, the two (just released) step-by-step dating and relationship manuals, </kw><a href="http://www.askapril.com/50first-dates-reviews.php" title="Dating Book - 50 First Dates"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-mrgtie-40">50 First Dates</kw></a><kw class="krdwrd-tag-mrgtie-40"> and </kw><a href="http://www.askapril.com/next50-dates-reviews.php" title="Dating Book - The Next 50 Dates"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-mrgtie-40">The Next 50 Dates</kw></a><kw class="krdwrd-tag-mrgtie-40">, and the critically acclaimed dating and relationship online magazine </kw><a href="http://www.askapril.com" title="Dating Tips and advice from April Masini"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1-60">www.AskApril.com</kw></a><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1-40">.</kw></p>
