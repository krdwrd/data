<p><font face="arial, helvetica"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">I would go to FTC.Gov and OIG.Gov for guidance. Basically messengers really can only "ACT" as a go between. The messenger can only pass information back and forth and cannot attempt to negotiate on behalf of the providers.
</kw></font></p><p>
<font face="arial, helvetica"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">The following is a recent article I wrote that you should find helpful (note the messenger also got sued by the government!); Call me at 713-975-1000 if you have any questions:

<font face="arial, helvetica"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-2-60">MESSENGER MODEL IPA’S MUST BE CAREFUL WHEN ATTEMPTING TO IMPLEMENT A MANAGED CARE STRATEGY
</kw></font></p><p>
<font face="arial, helvetica"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-2-60">Reed Tinsley, CPA
</kw></font></p><p>
</p><p>
<font face="arial, helvetica"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">It is a commonly known fact that most physicians practicing in this country generate some or most of their revenues from managed care revenues. It is also a known fact that most of these revenues are received on a “discounted fee for service basis.” While capitation may be significant in some medical service areas, this is usually the exception and not the rule in managed care service areas. To address managed care, many physicians around the country have formed messenger model IPAs. This model organizes physicians together to work with and/or negotiate with managed care payers on a shared basis.
</kw></font></p><p>
<font face="arial, helvetica"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">To create immediate negotiation leverage with managed care payers, these IPAs usually included a significant number of the physicians in a particular specialty in them. Unfortunately, these situations invite scrutiny by the government’s antitrust regulators. Years ago there was not much guidance on how messenger model IPAs were to operate. However over time, there has been much written by the government on what an IPA can and cannot do. This has been communicated mainly in the form of advisory opinions and the related Antitrust Enforcement Statements.
</kw></font></p><p>
<font face="arial, helvetica"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">Since managed care is not going to go away, IPAs will continue to remain as one way providers can address their concerns about managed care payers in their own marketplace. However, the government is and will continue to keep its watchful eye over these activities.  As such, you should remain up to date on the government’s requirements for creating and operating messenger model IPAs – this would include a constant review of the activities of the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department. In fact, one recent complaint by the government involves a messenger model IPA and the messenger itself. The government brought a civil antitrust against a surgical IPA located in Tampa Florida and its messenger, an accounting and healthcare consulting firm. The action was to prevent theme from negotiating with managed care plans jointly on behalf of otherwise competing IPA member physicians to obtain higher fees for their services.  
</kw></font></p><p>
<font face="arial, helvetica"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">The following is a discussion of this case - you should be able to use it as a guide if and when you are ever involved in a messenger model IPA situation.  This article will also provide tips and strategies when working in the messenger model IPA format.
</kw></font></p><p>
<font face="arial, helvetica"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-2-100">Background of the Case
</kw></font></p><p>
<font face="arial, helvetica"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-2-100">The Defendants
</kw></font></p><p>
<font face="arial, helvetica"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">The IPA was a Florida corporation with its principal place of business in Tampa, Florida. It comprised 29 physician shareholders who practice general or vascular surgery in the Tampa area.  The messenger is an  accounting and consulting firm that offers a wide range of services, in Tampa and elsewhere, to clients in the health care sector and other industries. 
</kw></font></p><p>
<font face="arial, helvetica"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-2-100">Overview of the General and Vascular Surgical Markets in Tampa
</kw></font></p><p>
<font face="arial, helvetica"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">There are seven hospitals in Tampa that provide general and vascular surgery services.   In 1996, the IPA’s general and vascular surgeons performed 87% of all general and vascular surgeries, and constituted over 83% of all general and vascular surgeons having operating privileges, at five of these hospitals (the “Primary Hospitals”).
</kw></font></p><p>
<font face="arial, helvetica"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">Tampa employers and other payers frequently use managed care plans (MCP) to provide cost-effective health care benefits to their employees and retirees and the families of those beneficiaries.  A MCP contracts with doctors on competitive terms by inducing its members to obtain their care from doctors in its provider network.  Doctors, for their part, compete to contract with MCPs by agreeing to lower prices, improve hospital utilization management, and provide care in less costly but medically appropriate settings, such as outpatient surgery facilities.  An MCP typically contracts with a sufficient number of providers (doctors, hospitals, and other health care providers) to offer a marketable plan to employers and an attractive panel of conveniently located, reputable providers to its members and prospective members.
</kw></font></p><p>
<font face="arial, helvetica"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">The MCPs operating in Tampa included some or all of the five Primary Hospitals in their provider networks, and a number of general and vascular surgeons who provide services at those hospitals, to effectively market their managed care products to employers in the Tampa area.
</kw></font></p><p>
<font face="arial, helvetica"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-2-100">Formation of the IPA 
</kw></font></p><p>
<font face="arial, helvetica"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">On or before May 21, 1997, several competing general and vascular surgeons in Tampa formed the IPA to negotiate jointly on their behalf with MCPs.  The IPA, according to the government’s complaint, was organized specifically to use the collective strength of its physician shareholders to improve “overall managed care reimbursement” to the IPA’s surgeons. The IPA’s objectives consequently included  “[o]btain[ing] contract terms more favorable than if each physician contracted separately” and  “[p]roactively us[ing] critical mass to obtain contracts at acceptable rates. . . .” 
</kw></font></p><p>
<font face="arial, helvetica"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">This is a very common reason why doctors band together into an IPA to deal with the constant pressures managed care plans bring upon them. Reimbursement rates have been dropping steadily over the past few years but the doctor’s business remains the same. The result is that doctors are working the same or harder but making less from managed care patients. Unfortunately managed care payers are forcing their own economics on to the backs of their providers. In order to maintain their net income levels, MCPs are just cutting what they pay doctors, in many cases without any distinguishment between cost effective providers and high cost providers.  In a nutshell, this is why many doctors around the country are forming messenger model IPAs – the physician community is sick and tired of how they are being treated by the payers. However, the government is watching these activities!
</kw></font></p><p>
<font face="arial, helvetica"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-2-100">The Contracting Strategy
</kw></font></p><p>
<font face="arial, helvetica"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">The IPA retained the accounting firm as its “messenger.” The goal to be achieved by the messenger was to coordinate the IPAs’s managed care contracting activities and assist in the renegotiation of existing physician contracts.  The messenger would first attempt to negotiate a favorable contract for the IPA’s surgeons with a particular managed care plan.  If that failed, the messenger would use a “contract-or-no-contract” negotiating strategy: The MCP could either contract through the IPA and have all the general and vascular surgeons belonging to IPA in the MCP’s provider network or not contract through the IPA and have none of the IPA’s surgeons in the network. The messenger would then recommend that the IPA’s board either  approve a negotiated contract and recommend that the IPA surgeons agree to it, or, if the messenger was unable to negotiate acceptable terms, reject the contract offered by the MCP. 
</kw></font></p><p>
<font face="arial, helvetica"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">This is where the IPA got into trouble. By adopting a “take it or leave it” stance, the IPA was inviting government scrutiny. A basic tenet of antitrust is that people cannot collude together to prevent competition in the marketplace and drive up prices. It appears this type of activity was going on with this IPA. 
</kw></font></p><p>
<font face="arial, helvetica"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-2-100">One Example of the IPA’s Negotiation with a Payer
</kw></font></p><p>
<font face="arial, helvetica"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">The IPA and the messenger’s first effort to negotiate with MCPs jointly on behalf of the IPA’s surgeons occurred in July, 1997, when the messenger contacted United HealthCare (“United”). The IPA’s surgeons represented 75% of United’s general and vascular surgical panel for Tampa and performed 87% of the surgeries for United at the Primary Hospitals.  In an August 29, 1997 letter, the messenger made clear to United that it was representing the IPA’s surgeons “as a group” and that the surgeons were seeking a contract with United “that would provide value to their practices.”  Around that time, United made an offer to the IPA  through its messenger.
</kw></font></p><p>
<font face="arial, helvetica"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">The IPA’s board of directors then discussed United’s contract offer and the possibility of all IPA surgeons resigning from United’s network.  The messenger then recommended to the IPA’s board that it not accept United’s contract offer and either make a counteroffer or “have all members terminate their [United contracts].”   The IPA’s board then instructed the messenger to make a counteroffer to United.  The messenger then informed United that unless United agreed to its demands, it would recommend that the IPA’s surgeons terminate their United contracts.  United agreed to the messenger’s contract demands, and the IPA’s board of directors voted to accept the revised contract. The jointly negotiated contracts paid the IPA’s doctors 30% more than United’s first offer and represented an average annual increase in revenue of $5,013 for each FCSSI physician.
</kw></font></p><p>
<font face="arial, helvetica"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-2-100">A Termination Occurs
</kw></font></p><p>
<font face="arial, helvetica"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">The messenger also attempted to renegotiate the IPA surgeons’ existing contracts with Aetna US Healthcare (“Aetna”).  In a letter, the messenger advised Aetna that “a few adjustments to your current fee schedule would allow us to recommend the surgical group [the IPA] accept an agreement with Aetna.”  In closing the letter indicated that, if Aetna met the proposed financial and contractual terms, the messenger would recommend that the IPA surgeons accept the Aetna contract.  
</kw></font></p><p>
<font face="arial, helvetica"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">Aetna subsequently offered the IPA’s doctors a contract that the messenger viewed as "no improvement" and without “concessions.”  The messenger then informed the IPA’s board of directors that “Aetna was unwilling to make changes to their standard contract for the IPA” and recommended that all IPA surgeons notify Aetna of their intent to terminate their contracts.  This recommendation was made with the knowledge that, without an Aetna contract, individual IPA surgeons faced a “potential 30% decrease in market share . . . additional risk for bad debts . . . [and] unhappy patients.”  The messenger advised the IPA board that the termination process would get Aetna’s attention, allow the messenger to negotiate better terms, and “better position the IPA for future discussions.”
</kw></font></p><p>
<font face="arial, helvetica"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">The IPA’s board of directors then voted to accept the messenger’s  recommendation that every IPA surgeon “send a Letter of Resignation, effective in 90 days, to terminate the contract with Aetna.”  In an “Action Required” letter, the messenger notified each IPA surgeon of the board’s decision and directed the surgeon to write a termination letter to Aetna following an outlined format.  Twenty-eight of the twenty-nine IPA surgeons wrote such a letter, and the messenger the forwarded  the termination letters to Aetna.  As a result of this alleged group boycott by the government, Aetna then proposed increased payment levels for the IPA’s doctors. 
</kw></font></p><p>
<font face="arial, helvetica"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-2-100">Impact of the Messenger’s Joint Negotiations
</kw></font></p><p>
<font face="arial, helvetica"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">According to the Justice Department, the IPA’s and the messenger’s joint negotiations and other alleged collusive activities left managed care plans with inflated contract rates for the doctors or an unmarketable network without the IPA’s surgeons.  The end result was that the MCPs paid the higher rates requested by the IPA.  In fact, the IPA board of directors wrote to their providers that: “We are pleased with the progress that the IPA has made with managed care organizations.  As you can see, the IPA has been able to obtain concessions from managed care entities and set a precedent for future negotiations.”
</kw></font></p><p>
<font face="arial, helvetica"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">According the to government, the President of the IPA also wrote to the other members that “[o]ur efforts with managed care organizations have produced extraordinary results” and that the financial benefit of the IPA’s joint negotiating efforts had amounted to an increase in revenues of $14,097 on average for each IPA surgeon, totaling $433,010 for all IPA members. In addition, the government contends that by contracting on behalf of all of its member surgeons or none at all, the IPA forced some MCPs to pay the doctors substantially higher fees and to contract with a greater number of general and vascular surgeons than the MCP had previously contracted with to service its members. 
</kw></font></p><p>
<font face="arial, helvetica"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">So as a result of the IPA’s and the messenger’s activities, the government contends that managed care plans in the Tampa service area faced significantly higher healthcare costs, which were ultimately born by the employers and their employees through higher insurance premiums or co-payments. The government even when on to state that these increased insurance premiums and co-payments may have even lead some employers and employees to forego health care insurance altogether.
</kw></font></p><p>
<font face="arial, helvetica"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-2-100">Improper Use of the “Messenger Model”
</kw></font></p><p>
<font face="arial, helvetica"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">According to the government, the conduct of the IPA and its messenger attempted to cloak their alleged antitrust activities as those of a legitimate  “third-party messenger,” which are described in the  Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission Statements of Antitrust Enforcement Policy in Healthcare, 4 Trade Reg. Rep. (CCH)  13,153 at 20,831 (August 28, 1996) (“Statements”).  The IPA claimed it was in compliance with the messenger model as described in the Statements.  However, there was documentation where the messenger, while claiming to be implementing the “messenger model” on behalf of the IPA’s surgeons, stated that the IPA’s goal was to get the physicians used to working cooperatively on managed care contracts and noted that “[i]f you have the majority of physicians in a geographic area, you have clout.” 
</kw></font></p><p>
<font face="arial, helvetica"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">According to the Statements, in a legitimate messenger model, the third party messenger acts merely as an efficient conduit for information and communications between managed care plans and individual physicians or physician group practices.  A legitimate messenger does not coordinate or engage in collective pricing activity for competing independent physicians, enhance their bargaining power, or facilitate the sharing of price and other competitively sensitive information among them.
</kw></font></p><p>
<font face="arial, helvetica"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">As a result of the IPA’s activities, the government charged the IPA with unreasonable restraint of interstate trade and commerce in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act. The government also charged the messenger as an active participant in this conspiracy.  
</kw></font></p><p>
<font face="arial, helvetica"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-2-100">Lessons to be learned
</kw></font></p><p>
<font face="arial, helvetica"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">As in most all cases, there are lessons to be learned by all of us. For those who are involved or will be involved in the formation and operation of a messenger model IPA, keep the following in mind:
</kw></font></p><p>
<font face="arial, helvetica"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-mrgtie-50">Follow the Enforcement Statements if too many doctors are invited and do participate in the IPA.
</kw></font></p><p>
<font face="arial, helvetica"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">The Statements say a group of doctors can organize even though, in a nonexclusive contracting arrangement, they represent more than 30% of the doctors of their medical specialty in their service area. The Statements are very explicit about what extra activities the IPA must do in order to remain in compliance. Always keep in mind the government does not like situations where doctors come together with the sole purpose of trying to increase health care costs. In this situation, the IPA must be able to show actual efficiencies created for the consumer and the marketplace as result of the doctors contracting together as an IPA.  Keep this thought in mind about the number of doctors in the IPA – if there is a termination by the IPA’s doctors, and the payer’s provider panel can be damaged as result, the IPA will and should have a concern about antitrust. 
</kw></font></p><p>
<font face="arial, helvetica"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-2-100">The IPA must perform utilization management activities
</kw></font></p><p>
<font face="arial, helvetica"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">Messenger model IPA’s must create and implement utilization management activities. They should also implement quality assurance programs internally. Sound IPA’s also perform outcomes management studies. All of these activities benefit consumers and managed care payers if implemented correctly and on an ongoing basis. This is one of the best ways to keep an IPA out of harms way with the government.
</kw></font></p><p>
<font face="arial, helvetica"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-2-100">Create a strategy where fees will not be jointly negotiated on behalf the IPA’s 
</kw></font></p><p>
<font face="arial, helvetica"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">This is the hard part but it can be done. The Messenger should talk to each doctor individually and by itself create a global contracting strategy for the IPA. Communications about fees and pricing between IPA members must be kept separate and never ever be discussed as a group. If this is done right, the messenger should be able to negotiate on behalf of each doctor “individually.”  In reality, payers want to contract with a group of doctors at the same rates, especially in those situations where the IPA brings tangible benefits to the payers. 
</kw></font></p><p>
<font face="arial, helvetica"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-2-100">Hire an experienced messenger
</kw></font></p><p>
<font face="arial, helvetica"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">This goes without saying but remember you get what you pay for. The messenger hired by the IPA should be able to demonstrate a working knowledge of antitrust guidelines and be able to show experience working with other messenger model IPAs in the past.
</kw></font></p><p>
<font face="arial, helvetica"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-2-100">Never make threats to a payer
</kw></font></p><p>
<font face="arial, helvetica"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">The goal of the IPA should be to work with payers and not necessarily perceive them as the enemy.  Making threats just pushes the payer into a corner, which then negatively affects the negotiation process. Workable IPAs find ways they can partner with payers to help contain and reduce their medical costs while at the same time give the IPA doctors a “raise in rates” in exchange for these activities.
</kw></font></p><p>
<font face="arial, helvetica"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-2-100">Try not to terminate a contract unless you absolutely have to
</kw></font></p><p>
<font face="arial, helvetica"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">Many times doctors get upset if a payer does not give them what they want. Unless the IPA is in full compliance with antitrust guidelines, a termination could result in a government investigation. All the payer has to do in this situation is turn the IPA in to the government. Also remember that a termination usually burns a bridge with the payer – in other words, the payer is not going to forget it anytime soon. Since payers are not going to go away, it behooves doctors to try to find a way to work with them. The doctors may have to sign up again with the payer sometime in the future. Instead of terminating, try to find out what the payer really wants from the IPA and try to deliver it to them. If a termination must occur, make sure each doctor votes independently and not as an IPA group. For those that do terminate, let the payer know which doctors have decided not to accept their contract and that the payer is free to negotiate with them individually. Let the payer also know these doctors are free to negotiate independently with the payer themselves. This gives each party their own opportunity to work with one another outside the confines of the IPA format. If the contract is terminated, it is by the doctor’s own choosing.
</kw></font></p><p>
<font face="arial, helvetica"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-2-100">Watch what you put into writing
</kw></font></p><p>
<font face="arial, helvetica"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">It is easy to get sloppy at times with our correspondence and our documentation of events. Just remember these materials could be used against the IPA during an investigation. At the end of the IPA’s first year of operation and every other year, a qualified attorney should be engaged to review all IPA activities, correspondence, and documentation. This type of independent review should keep the IPA in compliance with antitrust guidelines. Also, make sure the IPA uses its own attorney on an ongoing basis for this type of review. In many cases, once the attorney organizes the IPA, his or her involvement decreases substantially. 
</kw></font></p><p>
<font face="arial, helvetica"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-2-90">Watch what you say
</kw></font></p><p>
<font face="arial, helvetica"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">This is a reminder of the old saying “Loose lips sink ships.”  IPA activities to be kept private, even with doctor and other professional colleagues. Never brag or boast about your activities, especially successful contract negotiations by the IPA. These dealings are nobody’s business but the IPA’s.
