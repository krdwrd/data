      Australian scientists say analysis of the oldest DNA ever taken from skeletal 
      remains challenges the theory that all modern humans can trace their recent 
      ancestry to Africa. 
      </kw><p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">The study is based on the 60,000-year-old so-called Mungo Man skeleton, 
        which was unearthed in New South Wales in 1974, and nine other anatomically 
        modern Australian individuals who lived 8-15,000 years ago. </kw></p>

        mitochondria of these ancient people's cells. mtDNA, as it is known, is 
        inherited only from females and also mutates - errors appear - at a steady 
        rate, meaning it can be used as a "molecular clock" to investigate human 
        history.

      Recent lab studies of this type have suggested that our most recent common

        humans who left their African homeland no earlier than about 120,000 years

        Dr Thorne said. "We assert that when people began to leave Africa about 
        two million years ago, they were the ancestors of all modern people and 
        we don't think modern humanity emerged from one place later on.

        in Africa and there's no evidence that it, or the skeletal anatomy of 
        the fossil that it comes from, ever had anything to do with Africa. In 
        fact, the skeleton looks very much like slightly earlier fossils that 
        we know were in China."</kw></p>

      <p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">But Out of Africa supporters are not about to let go of their beliefs 
        because of the Australian research. Professor Chris Stringer, from the 
        Natural History Museum in London, UK, said that, given experience with 
        European fossils, there was some doubt over whether DNA analysis of such 
        old samples was reliable. And he said the research community would want 
        to see the work repeated in other labs before major conclusions were drawn 
        from the Australian research. 
      </kw></p><p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100"> But even assuming the DNA sequences were correct, Professor Stringer 
        said it could just mean that there was much more genetic diversity in 
        the past than was previously realised. 
      </kw></p><p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100"> "What it says is that some of that genetic diversity has been lost today," 
        he told BBC News Online. "This sequence could have been in Australia and 
        in Africa. In other words, it might have been in Africa 200,000 years 
        ago, [it] came out with some of the African people and then got lost. 
      </kw></p><p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100"> "There is no evidence here that the ancestry of these Australian fossils 
        goes back a million or two million years, which is the multi-regional 
        prediction." </kw><br>
