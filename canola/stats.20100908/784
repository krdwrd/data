<h2><kw class="krdwrd-tag-2-90">An overview of Pirate Flags</kw></h2>
<div style="">
  <p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">The "Jolly Roger" is used to refer to the skull and crossbones flag (white 
  on black) which is associated with Caribbean pirates. Although I think the name 
  comes from "jolie rouge" (Fr: "pretty red") which referred to an earlier all-red 
  flag reportedly used by some pirates.</kw><br>

  <hr width="60%">
  <p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">There's a lot of controversy about this, but the article I read from an information 
  column called </kw><em><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">The Straight Dope</kw></em><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100"> (I'm doing this from memory) said that 
  one of the origins might be from the title "Ali Rajah" given to one of the pirates.</kw><br>

  <p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">Pirate ships in the 15th to 17th Centuries which plied the Atlantic as far 
  east as Madagascar were often run as self-contained floating democracies (the 
  captain was usually only in undisputed charge during a battle), and each captain 
  and ship generally bore his or its own flag. Almost all were white or white and 
  red on black, and featured similar elements: skulls or skeletons (symbolizing 
  death; the pirate wanted to project fearlessness in the face of death, and some 
  flags pictured the captain toasting, dancing with, or literally conquering the 
  skeletal Death), swords and cannon (obvious symbolism), treasure chests (ditto), 
  hearts (often pierced, to symbolize "no mercy"), and pirates themselves. The classic 
  "skull-and-crossbones" was almost certainly among these designs. (I don't know 
  which pirate actually flew it. I know Calico Jack Rackham flew a skull and crossed 
  *swords*, but that's as close as I've found in my research.)</kw></p>
  <p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">In the early days of the so-called "Golden Age of Piracy" (mid-to-late 1500's), 
  pirates (especially French </kw><em><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">boucaniers</kw></em><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">, or buccaneers) kept two battle 
  flags, one plain red and one plain black. Before a battle, the captain would hoist 
  one or the other to show whether quarter was being given (for the non-English 
  speakers, this is an archaic expression meaning whether or not prisoners would 
  be taken). The red flag meant "no quarter" (no prisoners, slaughter every one 
  of the enemy). As pirate warfare became more brutal, the two different flags were 
  generally replaced by just one, the (usually) black flag, which was defaced as 
  above. But the flag kept the French nickname given to the red flag: joli rouge. 
  This was anglicized by English pirates to "Jolly Roger".</kw></p>
  <p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">Different pirates treated flags differently. Many would fly the flag of their 
  country until battle, when the black flag was raised; this was especially true 
  if the captain was a privateer -- one who sailed for a particular country and 
  carried a letter of marque, or signed permission from the country's ruler, to 
  prey on enemy ships. (Of course, the privateer often wasn't above taking a few 
  merchantmen here and there as well when the pickings got thin...) More independent 
  pirates, such as William Teach, better known as Blackbeard, kept a collection 
  of flags on board and simply raised whatever was most convenient in any given 
  situation.</kw></p>
  <p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">I'm not as certain about the flags of pirates of the Indian and Pacific Oceans. 
  I believe the red flag may have kept its original meaning in the Indian Ocean 
  or at least been a symbol of piracy, owing to the British request that a plain 
  red flag not be flown by any ships of the states in southern Arabia, resulting 
  in the red and white designs of Bahrain, Qatar, and members of the United Arab 
  Emirates.</kw><br>
  <em><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1-60">Steve "Scooter" Kramer</kw></em><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1-60">, 02 April 1997</kw></p>
  <hr width="60%">
  <p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">From what I have read, the no-quarter flag was red. According to one book (I 
  would have to make a search to get the reference for you), pirate flags were originally 
  red (hence the "jolie rouge" theory of the origin of "Jolly Roger") then, later, 
  two flags were kept on board. Black as an identification of the pirate vessel 
  and red (apparently the same design but in red) if "no quarter" was offered if 
  the victim fought.</kw></p>
  <p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">A red flag as a sign of no quarter was not unique to pirates. Gen. Santa Anna 
  raised the red flag at the Alamo for the same reason in the 19th century.</kw><br>
  <em><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1-80">William E. (Bill) Hitchins</kw></em><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1-60">, 04 October 1999</kw></p>
  <hr width="60%">
  <p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">Recently I did a bit of research into pirate flags, namely that of Bartholomew 
  Roberts. "One of piracy's most feared flags belonged to the greatest captain of 
  its Golden Age, Bartholomew Roberts. In his four-year career 'Black Bart', a Welshman, 
  captured over 400 ships and fabulous wealth. The fruits of one violent engagement 
  in Brazil against 42 Portuguese ships included sugar, hides, tobacco, gold plate, 
  coins worth 80,000 pounds and a diamond-studded cross that was destined for the 
  King of Portugal. He was fearless, innovative and a brilliant seaman. His fleet 
  scoured the world for treasure, inspiring utter dread in governments and their 
  navies. The Caribbean islands of Barbados and Martinique were particularly keen 
  to see an end to his activities (in 1720 Roberts captured the Governor of Martinique 
  and hung him from the mast), and Roberts' flag reflects the personal vendetta 
  he had with them. 'The Jack had a man portrayed in it with a flaming Sword in 
  his Hand, and standing on two Skulls subscribed ABH and AMH', i.e. a Barbadian's 
  and a Martinican's Head,' described an account of the time. The man portrayed 
  is Roberts himself. The flag he designed flew from his flagship, the Royal Fortune, 
  a brigantine he had captured from the French. Roberts was killed in battle against 
  HMS Swallow in 1722, on the African coast. The captain of the Swallow was subsequently 
  knighted for ridding the world of the 'Great Pyrate' Roberts."</kw></p>
  <p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">Other pirates who are known to have had their own flags are Christopher Condent, 
  Thomas Tew, Stede Bonnet, Muslim corsairs, Edward 'Blackbeard' Teach, 'Calico 
  Jack' Rackham, Captain Dulaien, Emmanuel Wynne, Henry Avery, Christopher Moody, 
  Edward Low. There have been other famous pirates - men and women - but it's not 
  certain what their flags were.</kw><br>
  <em><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1-60">David Cohen</kw></em><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1-60">, 3 April 1997</kw></p>
  <hr width="60%">
  <p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">It was recorded in a document of about 1300 that Norman ships hoisted "streamers 
  of red sendal called baucans" as a sign that no quarter would be given, when they 
  attacked a fleet of English, Irish and Gascon ships off the coast of Brittany.</kw></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">However later a red flag was known as the Flag of Defiance, Bloedvlag or Bloody 
  Flag and was merely a signal for battle.</kw></p>
  <p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">A black flag, as often used by pirates, was more often taken to mean "war to 
  the death".</kw><br>
  <em><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1-60">David Prothero,</kw></em><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1-60"> 12 November 1998</kw></p>
  <hr width="60%">
  <p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">I'm afraid I can find any "baucan", nor "baukan" (which are intended to mean 
  the same word in the paragraphs below) in my dictionary - even in my naval dictionary. 
  If such a word meant "streamer", the modern word for baucan would be "flamme" 
  or "banderole" (flamme in vexillology).The word "baucan" could be a variation 
  of "boucan" (which gave "buccaneer" to English), although it hasn't much to do 
  with vexillology. The boucan was the action of smoking meat and skin tanning by 
  adventurers in the Caribbean; the meaning of the word extended to mean the grill 
  on which such smoking was performed. Then the word "boucanier" (buccaneer) depicted 
  these adventurers, on land and sea, and became a synonym for pirate. Perhaps this 
  could be a hint, but this is just my guess.</kw></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">This was written at a time when spelling of French was not uniformly fixed, 
  and various regional spellings were commonly accepted too (and the texts below 
  are most likely to have been written by French Flemish subjects). Although this 
  is understandable old French, it is really different from modern French.</kw></p>
  <p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">I'm giving you a French version in modern spelling and grammar (but still old 
  "flavour"), and the English translation.</kw></p>

    <p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">I am finishing up a book on the pirates of Madagascar. I believe that, at 
    least up through the 1690s, the pirates continued to fly their national flags, 
    as the buccaneers had done. After all, Tew and the others had spent a lot of 
    effort and money to obtain a royal commission as a privateer precisely so that 
    they could flag an English flag. Why bother doing that if one is going to fly 
    a "pirate's" flag?</kw><br>
    <em><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1-60">Jan Rogozinski,</kw></em><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1-60"> 21 May 1999</kw></p>
    <hr width="60%">
    <p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-90">Some months ago images of pirate flags were added to FOTW-ws. I think it 
    is good to put them into perspective. Jan Rogozinski wrote 'Dictionary of Pirates' 
    (Original title: Pirates!, 1995), Wordsworth, Hertfordshire, 1997. First:</kw></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">Pirate Flags: In popular fiction all pirates flew the jolly roger - a skull 
      above crossed bones on a black background. However, this special flag was 
      used only by British and British-American pirates from about 1700 to 1725. 
      Other pirates attacked either under their own ruler's flag or under the flag 
      of the prince issuing their privateering commission. By flying a national 
      flag, pirates made a symbolic statement (often false) that the attack was 
      legal under that country's laws.</kw></p>
      <p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">Some nations sponsored piracy and lived off pirate booty, including Barbary 
      states, the Knights of Malta, and 17th-century England. In law, corsairs operating 
      from one of these havens had to fly its flag. This showed that the raiders 
      recognized and paid taxes to the ruler's law courts.</kw></p>
      <p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">While they were hunting, many pirates either flew no flag or used one that 
      would fool their intended victim. Their battle flag was raised only when they 
      were close enough to attack. Naval warships also used this trick. In 1815 
      American ships thus trapped Hamidou Reis by flying the British flag.</kw></p>
      <p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">From 1805 to 1810 a large pirate confederation dominated the Chinese coast 
      from Canton south to Vietnam. The raiders divided the coast into six territories, 
      each belonging to a pirate fleet with its own banner - red, black, white, 
      green, blue, and yellow. Since China had no national flag, every shipowner 
      devised a banner for the vessels he owned.</kw></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">In David Cordingly's "Under the Black Flag," an authoritative book about 
    pirates, the author mentions a "consultation signal" flag used when a pirate 
    captain wants to speak with another pirate captain on a nearby vessel. "A green 
    silk flag with a yellow figure of a man blowing a trumpet has hoisted at the 
    mizzen peak, and as the flag was raised, the pirates in the other ships came 
    across in their boats."</kw><br>

<p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">I was down the pub on June 21 (2007) having a discussion about flags with some vague
acquaintances, correcting the usual urban myths and so on, when this article was
drawn to my attention, from a 
</kw><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/06/21/nflag121.xml"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">UK newspaper</kw></a><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">
which I would never usually read, due to its terrible right-wing reactionary bias.</kw></p>

<p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">The newspaper version of the article actually contained a black and white
photograph of the flag, which is a bit like the flag above, save that it of course, 
has a red background and the skull was actually touching
the crossed bones, rather than floating above them.  It also has teeth, but no
jaw bone.   There is a better photograph on the

- also a right-wing reactionary newspaper which also states that the flag most 
probably originally formed part of a garment.</kw></p>

<p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">All of this has implications, as it confirms the
historical existence of a crimson or red skull and cross bones flag.</kw></p>

<p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-90">I know of the international reputation of the Textile Conservation Centre,
through a professional connection, but wondered if there is anyone else on the
list who knows about flag conservation and whether it is the usual practice to
mount a flag on board, in the manner which is described, or whether that is
usually only done if the flag is to be displayed?</kw><br>
