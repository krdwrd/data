<ol><font face="Arial" size="2">
  <li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">The UK Government introduced a decommissioning scheme in 1993. This was 
  part of an overall package of measures to reduce fishing capacity and, by 
  implication, effort (Para.1). 
  </kw><p></p>
  </li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">The other measures, subsequently adopted, included the introduction of a 
  restrictive licensing regime for vessels under 10 m and further restrictions 
  on the transfer of vessel licences (Para. 8). 
  </kw><p></p>
  </li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">Fleet reduction targets are set by the European Commission every four 
  years. These targets are laid out for each member state in Multi Annual 
  Guidance Programmes. Until 1996 there had been three MAGPs; arrangements for 
  the fourth were finalised in 1996 / 97. This evaluation relates primarily to 
  the fleet decommissioning scheme introduced by the Government as part of its 
  programme of compliance with the objectives of MAGP III. In addition to the 19 
  per cent overall reduction in GRT and engine power called for under MAGP III, 
  a reduction of another 11 per cent carried over from MAGP II (Para. 2). 
  </kw><p></p>
  </li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">The MAGP objectives are set in terms of tonnage and engine power for 
  pre-defined segments (Para. 4). The UK has defined 10 segments (Para. 5) based 
  on its principal fishing methods. These are: pelagic, beam trawl, demersal 
  trawl / seine, nephrops trawl, lines and nets, shellfish mobile, shellfish 
  static, distant water, non-active and vessels under 10 m (Para. 5).
  </kw><p></p>
  </li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">The UK decommissioning scheme operates on the basis of competitive 
  tendering, in which vessel owners submit a value per Vessel Capacity Unit 
  (VCU) for which they are prepared to decommission their vessels and surrender 
  their fishing licences. Each vessel has a VCU which is calculated on the basis 
  of (length) x (breadth) + (0.45 x engine power). Bids are ranked in ascending 
  order in terms of £ / VCU. Successful applicants are paid the amount they bid 
  (Para. 12) 
  </kw><p></p>
  </li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">There were 1,408 applications of which 578 were successful, 571 
  unsuccessful, 71 withdrawn and 187 ineligible. Of the successful applications, 
  314, 177, 69 and 18 were from England, Scotland, N.Ireland and Wales 
  respectively (Para. 14).
  </kw><p></p>
  </li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">A total number of 87,500 VCUs were removed from the fleet at a cost of £ 
  36 M . The average price paid per VCU withdrawn across the four years was £ 
  411(Para. 14). 
  </kw><p></p>
  </li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">Areas exhibiting the highest uptake of decommissioning grants were eastern 
  England (mainly Humberside) and N.Ireland (Para. 46).
  </kw><p></p>
  </li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">More than one third of vessels decommissioned were between 10 - 11.9 m. 
  The bulk of these vessels were registered in England. More than half those 
  vessels decommissioned in Scotland, 93 per cent of the vessels decommissioned 
  from N. Ireland and 40 per cent from England were between 15 and 24m in 
  length. Very few large vessels were decommissioned (Para. 38).
  </kw><p></p>
  </li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">There were two principal beneficiaries of the scheme. Just under 40 per 
  cent of the total decommissioned VCUs came from the demersal segment. A 
  further 30 per cent came from the nephrops trawl segment. Half the total 
  number of decommissioned vessels came from England; 31 per cent from Scotland; 
  17 per cent from N.Ireland; and 2 per cent from Wales, (Para. 19).
  </kw><p></p>
  </li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">The highest tenders came from North East Scotland (Peterhead, Fraserburgh 
  and Aberdeen), western Highlands (Stornoway and Mallaig) and N. Ireland. The 
  highest tenders by segment (Table 1.18) came consistently from demersal and 
  nephrops sectors. The lowest tenders came from North Shields and Ayr (Para. 
  46).
  </kw><p></p>
  </li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">Three distinct groups of vessels emerge from the operation of the four 
  schemes (Para. 26):
  </kw><p></p></li></font></ol>
<ul>
<font face="Arial" size="2">  <li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-60">segments that have exceeded their MAGP targets: the nephrops trawl and 
  shellfish mobile sector
  </kw><p></p>
  </li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-60">the segments that are near compliance with their targets: the demersal 
  trawl segment, nets and lines, and the distant water segment
  </kw><p></p>
  </li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-60">the segments that are under target: pelagic, beam trawl and shellfish 
  potters (fixed)
  </kw><p></p></li></font></ul>
<ol start="13">
<font face="Arial" size="2">  <li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">With the exception of the distant water and pelagic sectors, 
  decommissioning has had a strong impact in all groups, but especially in the 
  demersal trawl and nephrops segment. The impact of decommissioning has been 
  considerably reduced where fleet licensing policy has failed to curtail sector 
  expansion. This is the case in the beam trawl and pelagic segments (Para. 29). 

  </kw><p></p>
  </li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">As a result of decommissioning and other policies, the trend is an 
  increase in the average size of vessels over 10 m. In 1992, the number of 
  vessels in excess of 24 m represented 13 per cent of the fleet. It now 
  represents 26 per cent. Similarly the overall composition of vessels between 
  10-11.9m has fallen from 40 to 32 per cent over the same period (Para. 39).
  </kw><p></p>
  </li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">Decommissioned vessels had an average year of build of 1962 (Para. 35), 
  fewer days at sea than non-decommissioned vessels (Para. 40), and low annual 
  earnings (Para. 52). This implies that the scheme has only managed to take out 
  vessels exhibiting lower effort characteristics. This is true for most 
  segments affected by decommissioning. The exceptions are beam and some 
  nephrops trawlers where catch records from decommissioned vessels were judged 
  to be fairly high (Para. 44). Catches recorded in the demersal segment were 
  comparatively small.
  </kw><p></p>
  </li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">Vessels withdrawing from the scheme in 1996 had high catch records. This 
  allowed the vessel owners to gain significantly higher compensation by trading 
  their vessels and licences onto the open market (Para. 44).
  </kw><p></p></li></font></ol><b><i><font face="Arial">
</font></i></b><p><b><i><font face="Arial"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-2-70">The survey </kw></font></i></b></p>
<ol start="17"><font face="Arial" size="2">
  <li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">Skippers who applied for decommissioning fell into two main age groups; 
  34-45 years, and 45-55 years. These two groups accounted for 60 per cent of 
  all applications. Applications from skippers aged over 55 years accounted for 
  22 per cent of all applications (Para. 56).
  </kw><p></p>
  </li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">The key reasons for owners applying for decommissioning were: (a) 'vessels 
  reaching the end of their economic life'; and (b) 'a means of financing a new 
  vessel' (Para. 57).
  </kw><p></p>
  </li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">Twenty eight per cent of owners moved into the under 10 m sector. This 
  trend was particularly strong in the south west of England where two thirds of 
  successful applicants purchased under 10 m vessels (Para. 60). It is estimated 
  that as much as £ 14 M may have been re-invested into the sector, £ 10 M into 
  vessels over 10 m and £ 4 M into the under 10 m industry (Para. 57).
  </kw><p></p>
  </li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">As a result of rising licence values many of those taking decommissioning 
  to re-finance new purchases of over 10 m vessels, had difficulties in 
  re-entering the industry. This was also identified as one of the reasons why 
  some of the applicants withdrew from the scheme at the last minute (Para. 61).
  </kw><p></p>
  </li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">The majority of the successful applicants would have remained in the 
  industry had decommissioning not been available. 40 per cent stated that they 
  would have left the industry in any case (Para. 63). The majority (52 per cent 
  overall) said that they would have carried on fishing. Thirty three per cent 
  stated that they would have sold their vessel and licence. The strongest 
  desire to continue fishing was found in the distant water, pelagic and beam 
  trawl sectors (Para. 64).
  </kw><p></p>
  </li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">Whilst some vessel owners may have left the industry had there been no 
  decommissioning scheme, their vessels and licences would have remained active 
  (Para. 66). This capacity would have:
  </kw><p></p></li></font></ol>
<ul>
<font face="Arial" size="2">  <li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-70">been retained by existing vessel owners, presumably by those operating in 
  profit and not seeking retirement; or
  </kw><p></p>
  </li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-70">been sold on at reduced capital valuation commensurate with age and 
  earning capacity. For example, vessels close to the end of their economic life 
  might have attracted lower levels of investment and might have been more 
  likely to continue making marginal profits.
  </kw><p></p></li></font></ul>
<ol start="23">
<font face="Arial" size="2">  <li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">Forty seven per cent of those who were refused the award and 56 per cent 
  of those choosing to withdraw subsequently sold their vessels. The average 
  price fetched for vessels and their licences was higher in most segments than 
  the average bid from these applicants. This indicates that the vessel owners 
  realised the increased values in both licences and track records (Para. 67).
  </kw><p></p>
  </li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">The principal reason for withdrawing from the scheme was identified as 
  'higher price offered for licence / track record on the open market' and 
  'higher prices offered for the vessel on the open market' (Para. 71).
  </kw><p></p>
  </li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">When the vessels were sold onto the open market, higher prices, relative 
  to the average accepted VCU bid, were accepted when licences were sold 
  separate to the vessel. This indicates that these vessel owners probably took 
  account of the vessel, licence and track record values when determining the 
  initial tender price (Para. 68). 
  </kw><p></p>
  </li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">The significance of this development is that the removal of a significant 
  number of vessels from the fleet has led to an increase in demand for second 
  hand vessels (or more importantly their licences) providing ample reward for 
  many of those who failed to achieve the award. In effect, the decommissioning 
  scheme has contributed to the creation of a more dynamic market for second 
  hand vessels, with a premium being paid for vessel licences containing 
  significant track records (Para. 70). 
  </kw><p></p>
  </li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">The most significant levels of vessel and licence sales took place on the 
  east coast of England where more than 63 per cent of those remaining in the 
  industry subsequently sold their licences. Sales from North East Scotland 
  (mainly the Moray Firth) and the Highlands and Islands were also significant 
  (Para. 72).
  </kw><p></p>
  </li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-90">The principal reasons for the high demand for vessels and licence (Para. 
  72) were attributed to:
  </kw><p></p></li></font></ol>
<ul>
<font face="Arial" size="2">  <li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-60">the demand for high track records, in particular those for cod and plaice
  </kw><p></p>
  </li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-60">the increasing awareness amongst those remaining in the industry of the 
  need to legitimise their black fish activities 
  </kw><p></p>
  </li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-60">demand for capacity units to cater for new vessel constructions (in some 
  cases irrespective of track records). These new constructions were 
  specifically aimed at targeting deep water species. 
  </kw><p></p></li></font></ul>
<ol start="29">
<font face="Arial" size="2">  <li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">The first determining factor in establishing a bid price evolved from 'the 
  value of the vessel' in the years 1993 and 1994 to 'knowledge of the previous 
  decommissioning bids' in 1995 and 1996 (Para. 76). The next most important 
  factor over the four-year period was 'expected size of competing bids' 
  followed by 'required capital for future investment' (Para. 77).
  </kw><p></p>
  </li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">Most of the tenders were based on decisions made by the applicant himself 
  despite the fact that hearsay may have influenced his decision-making (Para. 
  78). Some applicants also took advice from fishermen's organisations and from 
  fish-selling agencies.
  </kw><p></p>
  </li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">Thirty three per cent of those who have not yet applied , said they would 
  consider applying in the future, (Para. 83). The strongest concentration of 
  interest came from the nephrops segment where around 69 per cent stated that 
  they would consider applying. Interest also remained high in the other 
  shellfish sectors (fixed and mobile). In the beam trawl sector only some of 
  the smaller vessel owners expressed interest in decommissioning. None of the 
  distant water sector expressed interest in decommissioning. The only interest 
  forthcoming in the pelagic segment came from the smaller class of traditional 
  pelagic trawlers.
  </kw><p></p>
  </li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">The largest geographic concentration of interest was amongst the N.Ireland 
  nephrops sector where more than half said they would consider applying. 
  Interest was voiced in north east England (North Shields, 20 per cent), north 
  east Scotland (14 per cent) and the Highlands and Islands. Continued interest 
  in decommissioning was also evident in the south west gill net fleet, the 
  small scale east coast of England gill net fleet, and the demersal segments in 
  south west Scotland, eastern England and south east England. Very few of the 
  vessels who indicated an interest had turnovers in excess of £ 200,000 (Para. 
  84).
  </kw><p></p>
  </li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">The main reasons for not applying were: that 'the fishery is profitable'; 
  and 'family in the industry' (Para. 85).
  </kw><p></p>
  </li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">Seventy one per cent of those in the industry believed decommissioning to 
  be a good policy (Para. 88). A high proportion of beam trawl operators 
  considered the scheme to be bad. Some were of the view that more could be 
  accommodated through allowing for the retention of licenses and track records. 
  In the pelagic sector most believed that while decommissioning had its merits, 
  it was irrelevant to them (Para. 90).
  </kw><p></p>
  </li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">The fishermen's comments suggest that decommissioning's biggest weakness 
  is that 'it has not been directed towards the most efficient vessels', and 
  that there were 'insufficient funds available for an adequate decommissioning 
  scheme' (Para. 94). The two major strengths identified were: 'that the scheme 
  has worked well' and it has 'facilitated new investment'. The major threat 
  identified was that without it, 'the stocks would be irreparably damaged'. The 
  two key opportunities are: 'to allow for the selling of track records', and 
  'to target the most efficient vessels doing most damage to stocks'.
  </kw><p></p>
  </li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">Sixteen per cent of successful applicants and 24 per cent of all 
  applicants said that their bid was highly speculative (Para. 97).
  </kw><p></p>
  </li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">The overall opinion from the industry was that VCUs were the most 
  appropriate tool for decommissioning (Para. 100). 
  </kw><p></p>
  </li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">When asked whether the scheme should be amended, 46 per cent of the total 
  number of respondents suggested that it should be altered to include other 
  features (Para. 101).
  </kw><p></p>
  </li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">The survey showed strong support for proposals to allow for the vessel to 
  be sold separately. Equally, separate selling track records has some 
  attraction, as does the possibility of establishing a fixed system of payments 
  (Para. 105).
  </kw><p></p>
  </li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">The study indicates that around 2,250 fishermen had to find alternative 
  work as a result of the decommissioning scheme (Para. 111).
  </kw><p></p>
  </li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">A significant proportion of skippers interviewed (27 per cent) returned to 
  sea as skipper, crew or mate (Para. 112) on other vessels. 35 per cent did not 
  continue in fishing but chose to remain in the marine field of work, for 
  example, sea angling, sea going pleasure trips and the operation of oil rig 
  support vessels (Para. 113).
  </kw><p></p>
  </li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">Twelve per cent of those who became unemployed were skippers. Most came 
  from the port of Grimsby (21 per cent) and Northern Ireland (14 per cent) 
  (Para. 114).
  </kw><p></p>
  </li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">The more skilled fishermen had little difficulty in seeking employment, 
  with most skippers (or engineers) gaining work within 6-12 weeks (Para. 115). 
  Unskilled crew workers found difficulties in obtaining jobs, particularly in 
  rural areas where they could be out of work for up to 9 months. Many of these 
  individuals to returned to sea.
  </kw><p></p></li></font></ol><b><i><font face="Arial">
</font></i></b><p><b><i><font face="Arial"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-2-90">The evaluation of the decommissioning scheme: Value for money</kw></font></i></b></p>
<ol start="44"><font face="Arial" size="2">
  <li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">The consultants estimate that 76,945 of the 87,000 VCUs removed from the 
  fleet through decommissioning would have been retained in the industry in the 
  absence of a decommissioning scheme. 9,955 VCUs may have been removed from the 
  fleet as a direct result of licence aggregation (Para. 119).
  </kw><p></p>
  </li><li value="45"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">The value of capital (as measured by insurance value) withdrawn 
  from the industry represents £ 80 M or approximately £ 913 / VCU. This is more 
  than twice the actual cost of decommissioning to date. This demonstrates, by 
  virtue of the operation of the tender scheme, that the Government has 
  historically been able to pay awards considerably below the perceived 
  commercial value of the vessel (Para. 125).
  </kw><p></p>
  </li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">According to the survey, licence values have risen substantially over the 
  four years, with licences in the pelagic, beam trawl, demersal and nephrops 
  segments worth £ 2,000, £ 1,250, £ 900 and £ 400 / VCU respectively (Para. 
  131).
  </kw><p></p>
  </li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">The value of capital (vessels and licences) within the UK fishing fleet is 
  estimated to be £ 1,245 M, with more than 70 per cent of the fleet 
  concentrated in the pelagic, demersal trawl and beam trawl segments. The 
  highest values per VCU are attributed to the distant water sector ( £ 6,120 / 
  VCU) and the pelagic segment (£ 5,597 / VCU). Beam trawlers, demersal trawlers 
  and net and line fishing vessels have correspondingly higher values per VCU, 
  whilst nephrops trawlers and shellfish vessels (mobile and static) remain at 
  the bottom end of the scale. These values are indicative of the high values 
  placed on the track record assigned to each vessel (Para. 133).
  </kw><p></p>
  </li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">Current licences are estimated to be valued at around 43 per cent of the 
  total asset value of the industry. For the pelagic industry, however, asset 
  values are estimated to amount to around 73 per cent of the total asset value 
  (Para. 134). 
  </kw><p></p>
  </li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">A comparison between the UK tendering scheme and the EU schedules for the 
  same vessels illustrates a saving to the UK Exchequer of £ 20 M (Para. 142).
  </kw><p></p>
  </li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">The system of tendering worked well in the early phases of the scheme, 
  with most bids below the EU rate. This has subsequently altered, with the 
  average submitted tenders exceeding the EU rates (Para. 147).
  </kw><p></p>
  </li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">Repeat applications from unsuccessful tenderers during years 1 to 3 of the 
  scheme saw individual bids being reduced over time which enhanced value for 
  money. In the later years, it appears that the tendering system was influenced 
  by the increase in the commercial environment or, more probably, the knowledge 
  of the level of bids that had been previously accepted (Para. 151).
  </kw><p></p>
  </li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">Most fishermen expressed the view that it was unnecessary to scrap the 
  vessel, since the ability to work a vessel was determined by licence, and not 
  the vessel. In some cases fishermen were actually dissuaded from applying 
  because of the sentimental attachment to their vessels (Para. 153).
  </kw><p></p>
  </li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">The costs associated with bidding for, winning and receiving 
  decommissioning moneys, net of the ability to realise some of the assets, (for 
  example through the sale of the engine and wheel house equipment), were not 
  considered to be prohibitive (Para. 158). Few vessels realised any capital 
  gain from the sale of equipment.
  </kw><p></p>
  </li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">Some of the applicants were unaware that the awards were subject to 
  capital gains or income tax. The tax burden could be a major disincentive to 
  owners seeking to decommission their vessel. Many owners opted to sell their 
  vessel onto the open market where the tax burden was significantly reduced, by 
  transferring the bulk of the asset value from the vessel to the non-taxable 
  licence value (Para. 160).
  </kw><p></p></li></font></ol><b><i><font face="Arial">

<ol start="55"><font face="Arial" size="2">
  <li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">The administration of the decommissioning scheme has been co-ordinated by 
  MAFF in collaboration with the other UK Fishery Departments. The fisheries 
  officers in the ports facilitate the applications, and the scheme is 
  administered via the national offices in Edinburgh, Belfast, and Cardiff to 
  MAFF in London (Para. 164).
  </kw><p></p>
  </li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">When setting up the scheme, Fisheries Departments set a number of criteria 
  for qualification. These have generally met with widespread support in the 
  industry. The two areas that received more criticism than others were the 
  exclusion of specific segments and the exclusion of newer vessels (Para. 105).
  </kw><p></p>
  </li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">The survey found the UK application form to be extremely well designed. 90 
  per cent of those interviewed indicated that the form was easy to follow 
  (Para. 168)
  </kw><p></p>
  </li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">Ninety per cent of those interviewed were complimentary about the role of 
  the Fishery Departments in administering the scheme, both in terms of 
  facilitating the applications at port level and in terms of the assistance 
  given to fishermen if seeking advice on the completion of the form (Para. 
  170).

<ol start="59"><font face="Arial" size="2">
  <li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">Most countries choosing to adopt a decommissioning scheme have set their 
  objectives primarily towards the reduction of fishing capacity rather than 
  effort (Para. 175).
  </kw><p></p>
  </li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">All EU countries, with the exception of the UK, adopt a system based on 
  fixed rates. In the main these follow directly EU guidelines (Para. 176).

  </li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">Most countries outwith the EU have evolved from traditional fixed systems 
  to either a bidding system linked primarily to revenue and by implication 
  effort (USA and Canada), or an individual quota system (Australia). In 
  Australia, evidence has shown that when the two schemes operate in tandem, the 
  interest in decommissioning reduces (Para. 177).
  </kw><p></p>
  </li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">When the UK scheme was first introduced it incorporated the system of 
  VCUs. In view of recent changes to the performance and construction of new 
  vessels, there is now some concern as to whether this system is still 
  appropriate or whether the Gross Tonnes (GTs) system is more appropriate(Para. 
  188)
  </kw><p></p>
  </li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">The current UK scheme is transparent in design. As a result, fishermen are 
  over-familiar with the system. While this is welcomed from an administrative 
  point of view, it has allowed a significant amount of learning and owners find 
  it increasingly easy to project the likelihood of being successful at 
  increasingly higher rates (Para. 189). It might therefore improve VFM to 
  introduce some changes into any future selection mechanism.

<ol start="64"><font face="Arial" size="2">
  <li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">The UK was faced with the need to achieve very ambitious targets with the 
  objective of reducing tonnage (as opposed to effort, or, by implication, 
  fishing by the most efficient vessels) (Para. 191)
  </kw><p></p>
  </li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">Reduction in effort might be more productive if targeted at the payment of 
  higher awards to those vessels placing greater pressure on the stocks and 
  fishing more efficiently (Para. 200).
  </kw><p></p>
  </li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">The UK's fleet decommissioning scheme has been successful until now as it 
  has reduced overall and potential capacity at a considerably lower cost to the 
  Exchequer than payment of the full value of the assets themselves or the 
  payment of those costs associated with the equivalent EU scheme. However, the 
  most significant feature is that the reduction in capacity has been the prime 
  cause of increased competition for the ownership of access rights to the 
  sector. This has considerably enhanced the value of the vessel owner's asset 
  (Para. 224) making decommissioning extremely expensive.
  </kw><p></p>
  </li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">In addition to the decommissioning scheme, the Government has operated a 
  restrictive licensing regime which has resulted in an average aggregation 
  penalty of 17 per cent over a five year period. Latterly there has been a 
  penalty of 29 per cent. This has contributed increasingly to the reduction in 
  fishing capacity. However, in overall terms, the net contribution to date is 
  unlikely to have been more than 5 per cent of total capacity (Para. 225) . 
  </kw><p></p>
  </li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">The problem now is that the extension of the existing scheme into another 
  tranche will only meet with interest from some of the groups who have already 
  complied with the MAGP III targets. However, new targets for MAGP IV have been 
  set and further decommissioning schemes might be warranted as part of a 
  package of measures to meet these (Para. 209).
  </kw><p></p>
  </li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">The groups of vessels that would be likely to remain attracted to 
  decommissioning are essentially those sectors where there is little pressure 
  to acquire additional track records, for example the shellfish and nephrops 
  sectors (Para. 210). 
  </kw><p></p>
  </li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">There is a strong likelihood that the class of vessel applying will still 
  exhibit similar characteristics to those that have been withdrawn to date, 
  namely that they will have lower track records and fewer days at sea than 
  other vessels in these groups (Para. 211). 
  </kw><p></p>
  </li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">The increase in capital worth of vessels will encourage most vessel owners 
  in possession of high track records to retire by selling their licences on the 
  open market as opposed to through decommissioning (Para. 212). 
  </kw><p></p>
  </li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">Those vessels exhibiting high rates of profit, i.e. the pelagic sector, 
  beam trawl segment, distant water segment and the profitable elements of the 
  demersal trawl, segment remain highly unlikely to apply (Para. 213).
  </kw><p></p>
  </li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">Failure to achieve specific fleet reduction targets for specific segments 
  suggests that retaining the scheme in its current form will compound the 
  imbalance in the UK 's MAGP targets. Similarly, retaining the tender system in 
  its present form will attract the accusation that the scheme could become 
  increasingly subject to collusion (Para. 214).
  </kw><p></p>
  </li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">The next scheme, if one is to be introduced, should centre on specifically 
  attracting the withdrawal from the fleet, those vessels that fall outside MAGP 
  objectives in terms of capacity and effort. This will require either a 
  significantly larger budget to cater for the high financial expectations of 
  some of these groups, a degree of segregation in the decision-making process 
  to allow for specific groups to obtain priority, or the introduction of a 
  degree of unpredictability into the scheme, notably a system of awards linked 
  to higher payments for vessels with more days at sea or higher track records 
  (Para. 214).
  </kw><p></p>
  </li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">One means of encouraging lower bids is to allow for the selling of track 
  record separate to decommissioning. This option should lower the prospective 
  pricing of tenders and encourage some of the more profitable groups to apply 
  (Para. 216).
  </kw><p></p>
  </li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">The facility for pelagic vessels to purchase Category A white fish 
  licences must be withdrawn, since it is imperative that rationalisation based 
  on track record exchanges is confined to specific segments (Para. 216).
  </kw><p></p>
  </li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">An additional alternative would be for the Government to decommission 
  vessels (inclusive of quota entitlements) and retain the quota for subsequent 
  auctioning on the open market. To redistribute the quota on a pro rata basis, 
  without realising the market value, could certainly be considered a misuse of 
  public funds. However, retaining the existing system could be considered 
  justifiable if the industry itself contributed substantially to the costs of 
  the decommissioning scheme (Para. 219).
  </kw><p></p>
  </li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">Two features stand out as being significant barriers to would-be 
  applicants. These are taxation and the requirement to scrap the vessel (Para. 
  222).
  </kw><p></p>
  </li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">International experience has tended to show that decommissioning schemes 
  can often be displaced more effectively by a system of transferable fishing 
  rights. This may apply either to quotas, or to days combined with the overall 
  fishing entitlement, such as the licence. In countries such as Australia, 
  where the two schemes have been operating in tandem, it is the system of 
  transferable quotas that has achieved the greatest levels of capacity 
  reduction. This has led to a failure to take up annual budgets for 
  decommissioning (Para. 226).
  </kw><p></p>
  </li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">The UK Government is currently exploring the prospects of fixing catch 
  records to licences. In previous arrangements catch records would vary 
  according to a three year rolling track record. If introduced, and if the link 
  to the licence is retained, requiring the purchase of a catch record to be 
  synonymous with the purchase of the licence itself, it is likely that the 
  market would be capable of achieving substantial reductions in fishing 
  capacity via transfer of aggregation penalties) without the use of public 
  funds. However, there may be some doubt that this will achieve reductions in 
  fishing effort (Para. 227).
  </kw><p></p>
  </li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">If the Government is intent on achieving an effective reduction in both 
  effort and capacity, the combining of the transferability of individual quotas 
  and days along with licences could achieve a rapid fleet adjustment process 
  (Para. 228).
  </kw><p></p>
  </li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">A potential concern is that such a scheme would lead to a considerable 
  change in the structure of the industry. The likelihood would be that the UK's 
  capacity would veer increasingly towards the larger class of vessel, thus 
  leading to the concentration of the fleet in only a few locations . This may 
  have undesirable social costs (Para. 228).
  </kw><p></p>
  </li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">As ambitious targets are set by the European Commission for large scale 
  reductions in fleet capacity, it is unlikely that the levels of reduction 
  required by the policy makers will be met through licence aggregation and the 
  purchase of effort or quota. This may mean that decommissioning still has some 
  part to play. Nevertheless, if decommissioning is to form a part of the UK's 
  fleet structural policy, then it is unreasonable to expect that the cost of 
  this scheme should be met solely by Central Government. The evidence from the 
  survey shows conclusively that the industry has benefited substantially from 
  the scheme. Therefore, any future scheme should include a component of 
  industry funding (Para. 229).
