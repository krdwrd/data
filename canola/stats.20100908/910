<font face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">	In 1977, the late Fela Kuti wrote a bitter song called "Upside Down." Why is it, he asked, that in Asia, Europe, and North America, roads are repaired, telephones work, mail is delivered, whereas in Africa everything is upside down, nothing seems to function? 
</kw></font></p><p><font face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">Twenty years later an African expatriate in America, Manthia Diawara, has written </kw><i><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">In Search of Africa</kw></i><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">, which asks that same confounding question: "Why can't [Africa] catch up with the industrialized countries?" But unlike Kuti's song, which has an air of hopelessness, Diawara urges that there is a way out of our current misery. "The salvation of Africa," he writes with total confidence, "lies in modernization." In other words, Africans must become less tribal, less provincial, more international, and more secular if they hope to improve their situation and experience "the good life," as Diawara calls it, enjoyed in the West. 
</kw></font></p><p><font face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">Diawara (a professor of comparative literature and film at New York University), credits this modernization theory to </kw><i><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">Black Power</kw></i><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">, a 40-year-old memoir by Richard Wright, who openly criticized Africans for their "tribal ways" and "superstitions." While Diawara agrees with Wright, he also stresses that Africa must not leave to "white people the task of our modernization"; the mechanisms for African industrialization must originate with Africans. 
</kw></font></p><p><font face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><i><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">In Search of Africa</kw></i><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100"> is not contained neatly like an American mall, but operates like the stalls of an African market, offering from chapter to chapter a bit of memoir, a study of Black American and African cinema, African music, 20th-century art, and political and economic theory. But the African market is more than a metaphor, it's a real and thriving institution— particularly in Dakar, Accra, and Timbuktu, where consumers can select from a wild array of goods and services offered by entrepreneurs and craftspeople. These "traditional markets are the only places where Africans of all ethnic origins and classes, from the country and the city, meet and assert their humanity and historicity through consumption. . . . When peasants leave their villages for the city, they get 'modernized' in the marketplace." Diawara believes the market has the potential to liberate women ("entrepreneurial skills raise them to the rank of rich male merchants") and reduce Africa's dependence on European aid and economic models. 
</kw></font></p><p><font face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">If Diawara's "market" theory works impressively as a structural model for his book, it doesn't translate into real-world solutions. By locating Africa's problems within academic theory, rather than in the workaday world of bank loans, credit, and interest payments, Diawara helps obscure the real source of Africa's present crisis— lack of investment. Taiwan, South Korea, and Japan (countries he often mentions to support his theories on non-Western modernity) became "modern" because bankers and governments in the West made enormous investments in those countries. The blunt fact is, Africa has never been invited by the West to become a proper member of the modern international economy, and until that invitation arrives, consider the case hopeless.
