<p>   
</p><p>   <img src="/images/n.gif" alt="N" align="left"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-90">EW YORK  --  A man of experience Monday found something positive
in the Yankees' lopsided loss to the Atlanta Braves in the first
game of the World Series.
</kw></p><p><a href="/specials/baseball/"><img src="rubricworldseries.gif" align="right" border="0"></a><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">"Joe Torre doesn't have to say anything in the locker room
today," Dick Groat said. "There's nothing to talk about. I don't
remember anyone bringing up those games anywhere. It was a closed
chapter."
</kw></p><p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">   Groat played for the 1960 Pittsburgh Pirates. As he watched the
Braves' 12-1 victory Sunday night on television at his Pittsburgh
area home, he said, "it reminded me of '60." As the Yankees
prepared for the second game of the World Series, they could have
buoyed themselves by reading about the 1960 series.
</kw></p><p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">   That October it was the Yankees who were doing the drubbing.
They trounced the Pirates, 16-3, in the second game, 10-0 in the
third game and 12-0 in the sixth game. But the Pirates won the
World Series. They won by edging the Yankees by 6-4 in the first
game, 3-2 in the fourth game, 5-2 in Game 5 and 10-9 in the
memorable seventh game.
</kw></p><p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">   In the seven games, the Yankees scored 55 runs and batted .338;
the Pirates scored 27 runs and batted .256. But the Pirates won
four games, the Yankees three. That made the Pirates the World
Series champions.
</kw></p><p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">   "There was probably more pressure on the Yankees than on us,"
Bill Virdon, the Pirates' center fielder that year, recalled
Monday. "We were there, but we weren't supposed to win. Everybody
else figured the Yankees would win. We didn't accept that. We knew
we were going to show up and play and if we were good enough, we
could win."
</kw></p><p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">   After the Yankees suffered the shocking loss, Virdon added:
"They were very professional about it. They weren't happy about
it; they didn't come to lose. I thought everybody was very good
about it as far as I know."
</kw></p><p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">   The Pirates were ecstatic, of course. The lopsided losses didn't
bother them a bit  --  once the Series was over.
</kw></p><p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">   "I really think personally if you're going to get beat I'd just
as soon get beat by a big score," Virdon said by telephone from
his home in Springfield, Mo. "You can't look back and say I
could've done this, I could've done that. When you get beat, 15-1,
you can't look back and say maybe, or it could've been, so you just
forget about it. The only thing you want to avoid is to have that
happen four times. We had it happen three times. Fortunately, we
were able to win in between."
</kw></p><p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">   Groat, the Pirates' shortstop and National League most valuable
player that season, echoed Virdon's view about the difference in
the way the Pirates suffered their three losses.
</kw></p><p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">   "The reason it works very much in your favor," Groat said,
"is there's absolutely no second-guessing when you get beat that
badly. No one says, 'If I hadn't kicked that ground ball, if I had
advanced that runner.' It's easier to take those defeats."
</kw></p><p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">   Groat recalled that Danny Murtaugh, the Pirates' manager, took
him out of the second game after six innings when the Yankees led,
12-1. He had just come back from a broken wrist, and Murtaugh
figured he could spend his time better with his wrist in the
whirlpool. That's where he was when the game ended, and Bob Friend
and Bill Mazeroski came rushing over to him.
</kw></p><p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">   " 'Roomie,' " Groat recalled Friend said, " 'you missed the
granddaddy of them all.' All they talked about was the home run
Mantle hit off Joe Gibbon over the iron gate."
</kw></p><p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">   Mickey Mantle hit two home runs in that game, a two-run shot
against Fred Green into the right-field stands in the fifth inning
and a three-run blow against Gibbon over the center-field wall in
the seventh.
</kw></p><p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">   "Mantle hit some monstrous shots in that series," Groat said.
"A young left-hander by the name of Freddy Green had a great year.
I don't know if he ever got over that series. Mickey hit one that
tore out seven seats in the right field stands at Forbes Field."
</kw></p><p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">   Mantle also hit a home run against Green into the left-field
bullpen at Yankee Stadium in the third game.
</kw></p><p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">   Virdon vividly remembered the blast by Mantle that Groat only
heard about. The iron gate Groat mentioned, through which fans
would exit Forbes Field after games, was 457 feet from home plate.
</kw></p><p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">   "It actually went to the left of the iron gate," Virdon said.
"It was one of the longest I ever saw. I took about three steps,
looked up and it had to be 50 feet over my head, at least 50 feet,
and it wasn't coming down. It had to go 600 feet."
</kw></p><p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">   As far as the Pirates were concerned, though, Mantle's home run
was not as majestic or as memorable as the one Mazeroski hit
against Ralph Terry in the ninth inning of the seventh game. That
drive sailed over the left-field wall at Forbes Field and carried
the Pirates to the World Series championship. "We grew up with Mr.
Branch Rickey," Groat said, referring to the venerable genius of
baseball development. "He always said when we were growing up and
losing so many close games that the difference is, great teams win
the close games."
</kw></p><p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">   The Braves haven't made three of their last four games close.
They beat St. Louis, 14-0 and 15-0, in two of the last three
National League Championship Series games and the Yankees, 12-1. In
their last four games before Monday night they had outscored the
Cardinals and the Yankees by 44-2. The 44 runs are the most ever
scored by a team in four successive post-season games (37 was the
previous high), not to mention five successive.
</kw></p><p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">   "I'm a very staunch National League fan, and I love the
Cardinal organization," said Groat, who played for the Cardinals
after the Pirates. "Yet I felt if a National League team was going
to beat the Yankees, it had to be the Braves with their pitching
staff."
</kw></p><p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">   What he didn't figure was that the Braves would beat the Yankees
with their hitting, too.
</kw></p><p>
