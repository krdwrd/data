        Gold necklaces were first worn by nobles. The later Monarch of these times 
        was Ollamh Fodhla, pronounced "Ollav Fola". He was celebrated 
        as a philosophical statesman, for his improvements in the science of government, 
        and for the mild and enlightened principles of his policy. He instituted 
        an assembly resembling modern parliaments that convened every three years. 
        The poet-historians from all the provinces related all that had happened 
        between assemblies. It was during these assemblies that family genealogies 
        were carefully examined, corrected, and then entered in the national records 
        kept at Tara. These records were of great importance because a man's right 
        of inheritance to property depended on his genealogy. These records were 
        ordered by Fodhla to be 'written' and carefully preserved at Tara. They 
        were added to after each meeting and in King Cormac's time they were named 
        "The Psalter of Tara". It appears from the ancient chonicles 
        that some form of writing was known in that time. Eithrial, the 11th Monarch, 
        was also credited with writing in his own hand, the history of the Gaels 
        (or Gadelians). </kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-50">
