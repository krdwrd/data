	<p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">Liverpool's trade with North America began in the 1660s, but the city's trade with Asia didn't develop until the early
	19th century. Why was this and why was Asian trade so important? Find out below.</kw></p>

	<h3><kw class="krdwrd-tag-2-100">Why did Asian trade begin?</kw></h3>

	<p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">Until the 19th century the East India Company, based in London, controlled all trade to Asia. From 1830 other people were
	allowed to trade to India and from 1833 to China. Liverpool merchants were quick to enter these trades.</kw></p>
	
	<h3><kw class="krdwrd-tag-2-100">Why was Asian trade so important to Liverpool?</kw></h3>
	
	<p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">The countries of Asia developed quickly. They needed to import manufactured goods to develop their communications and
	services. They also had raw materials and foods to send to the growing industrial towns of Northern England.</kw></p>
	
	<p><b><kw class="krdwrd-tag-2-100">From Liverpool to Asia:</kw></b><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-90">Manufactured goods like railway engines, building materials and pottery.</kw></p>
	<p><b><kw class="krdwrd-tag-2-100">From Asia to Liverpool:</kw></b><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-90">Raw materials like cotton and silk, and foods like tea and spices.</kw></p>
	
	<p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">Liverpool's trade with Asia grew quickly, especially with the countries which were part of the
	</kw><a href="gl_empire.asp" class="gloss"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-90">British Empire</kw></a><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-60">.</kw></p>
	
	<h3><a id="bea" name="bea"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-2-100">Beyond Asia</kw></a></h3>
	
	<p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">From the 1850s large numbers of people left Britain to start new lives in Australia and New Zealand. Ships left Liverpool full of
	passengers but left Australia empty. Companies could increase their profits on these routes by stopping off in India and China
	on the way back, and loading up with high value goods

	<h3><a id="lvl" name="lvl"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-2-100">Liverpool vs. London</kw></a></h3>
	
	<p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">In 1830 London controlled more Asian trade than Liverpool. However, this soon changed. By 1850s Asia was Liverpool's third most
	important trading partner. These are some of the reasons why trade increased.</kw></p>
	
	<ul>
		<li><b><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">Trains and steamships</kw></b><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100"> meant quicker communications across the world, both by mail and face to face. This made it easier
		for Liverpool to compete with London.</kw></li>
		<li><a href="gl_clipper.asp" class="gloss"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">Clipper ships</kw></a><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100"> were developed. They were fast, deep-sea
		sailing ships that allowed </kw><b><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">quick delivery</kw></b><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100"> of high value Asian cargoes, such as tea.</kw></li>
		<li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">In 1844 Liverpool </kw><b><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">cut dock dues</kw></b><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100"> (payment for using the docks).</kw></li>
		<li><a href="gl_bonded.asp" class="gloss"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">Bonded warehouses</kw></a><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100"> like those at the Albert Dock made Liverpool much more popular.</kw></li>
		<li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">During the American Civil War (1861-65) Liverpool's main supply of cotton (from the southern states of America) was reduced.
		To make up for this more cotton was imported from Mumbai. Indian cotton was cheaper and more abundant than American
		cotton. However, once the war ended American cotton again became dominant.</kw></li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3><kw class="krdwrd-tag-2-100">Ships &amp; Routes to Asia</kw></h3>
	
	<p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">In 1866 Alfred Holt's Blue Funnel Line began steamer services to China. Until then sailing ships had been cheaper and easier
	to run. Holt invented a new engine which was reliable and used far less coal, making steamer voyages profitable. Steamships were
	also faster than sailing ships.</kw></p>
	
	<p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-90">The opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 helped Liverpool's Asian trade.  The canal connected the Mediterranean and the
	Indian Oceans, and made it even easier to reach Asia. Before the canal opened ships either had to:</kw></p>
	
	<ol class="alph">
		<li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-60">sail right around Africa, or</kw></li>
		<li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-60">unload goods and passengers at Port Said (Mediterranean) and transfer them across land to Suez (Red Sea).</kw></li>
	</ol>
	
	<p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">Only steamers could really use the Suez Canal.  High towing charges and difficult winds in the Red Sea meant sailing ships
	were not suited. Instead they carried bulk materials, e.g. railway iron and coal, around the southern tip of Africa (the Cape
	of Good Hope) to Asia.</kw></p>

	<ul>
		<li><b><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-60">1840s</kw></b><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-70"> - Princes Dock began to trade in the high value low bulk Asia markets, e.g. spices. New transit
		sheds and a dock wall were built to protect the goods.</kw></li>
		<li><b><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-60">1863</kw></b><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-60"> - the Asia trade at Princes Dock is growing and makes up 10% of Liverpool's Asian trade.</kw></li>
		<li><b><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-60">1910</kw></b><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-60"> - most of the Asia trade had moved to docks on the Wirral side of the river.</kw></li>

	<h3><a id="ad" name="ad"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-2-100">Albert Dock &amp; Asia</kw></a></h3>
	<p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-70">Albert Dock was used as an unloading dock for deep-sea ships from Asia. Cargoes included:</kw></p>
	<ul>
		<li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1-60">Tea</kw></li>
		<li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1-60">Silk</kw></li>
		<li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1-60">Dyestuffs</kw></li>
		<li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1-60">Cotton</kw></li>
		<li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1-60">Rice</kw></li>
		<li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1-60">Hemp (plant stems used to make rope)</kw></li>
		<li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1-60">Jute (plant bark used to make rope).</kw></li>
	</ul>
	<p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">The Albert Dock was ideal for storing goods like silk, cotton and wool.  The warehouses were </kw><a href="gl_bonded.asp" class="gloss"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">bonded</kw></a><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100"> so were safe,
	and also had good natural light and ventilation on the top floors to keep goods fresh.</kw></p>
	<p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">By 1855 52% of Liverpool's total income from Asia came from the Albert Dock. The dock was very successful in
	Asian trade until around 1890. After this time it was too small for these ships so they moved to other larger docks.</kw></p>

	<h3><a id="wd" name="wd"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-2-100">Wapping Dock &amp; Asia</kw></a></h3>
	<p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-60">Wapping Dock was mainly a passage to other docks. However its warehouses did deal with some trade from the Asia
	in the 1860s including:</kw></p>
	<ul>
		<li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1-60">tea</kw></li>
		<li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1-60">spices</kw></li>
		<li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1-60">cotton - particularly during the American Civil War when that supply of cotton was cut off</kw></li>

	<h3><a id="bd" name="bd"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-2-100">Birkenhead Docks &amp; Asia and Australasia</kw></a></h3>
	<p><b><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-60">Emigrants:</kw></b><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100"> Some of the first exports from Birkenhead were people. A depot was built in Birkenhead in 1852 for those leaving on
	the Emigrant Commissioners' vessels. The journey from Birkenhead to Australia or New Zealand often took three or four months.</kw></p>
	<p><b><kw class="krdwrd-tag-2-60">Cargo:</kw></b><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100"> Much of Merseyside's Asian trade was based at Birkenhead. Companies such as Brocklebank, Bibby, Holt and Clan
	exported many finished goods from the Midlands (the manufacturing capital of Britain) via Birkenhead. The dock specialised in
	handling bulky cargoes, such as vehicles and transport systems.</kw></p>
	<p><b><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-60">Fuel:</kw></b><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100"> In the early days of steam ships, 'hard steam' coal from South Wales was essential. Brought to Birkenhead by rail, it was
	loaded into the empty </kw><a href="gl_bunker.asp"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">bunkers</kw></a><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100"> of outgoing vessels and the holds of sailing ships. These vessels kept stockpiles for later use at
	ports around the </kw><a href="gl_empire.asp" class="gloss"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">British Empire</kw></a><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">, including Asia.</kw></p>
