    <h3><font color="#0000ff"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-2-80">2.1 TORTOLA PIER AND ANCHORAGE CHARACTERISTICS</kw></font></h3>
    
    <p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-80">The new Cruise Ship Pier is 755 ft (230 m) long with a deck approximately 6 ft (1.83 m) above sea level. A mooring dolphin is positioned 259 ft (79 m) off the end of the pier, providing a total berthing space of 1014 ft (309 m) on each side of the pier. The pier has also been fully widened with a depth of 32.8 ft (10 m) alongside which enables two large size cruise liners to berth simultaneously. The Cruise Ship Pier was built initially in 1993 and was extended in 1999. The pier is structurally sound and in mint condition and uses tubular hard rubber fenders with chains attached from the top and bottom (</kw><a href="fig_xli-15.htm" target="rt"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1-50">Figure XLI-15</kw></a><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-50"> and </kw><a href="fig_xli-16.htm" target="rt"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1-50">Figure XLI-16</kw></a><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-80">). Fendering on the pier is located every 100 ft (30.5 m).</kw></p>
    
    <p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">The turning basin 0.4 mile south, south east of the cruise pier has a radius of 1,001 ft (305 m), and a minimum depth of 37 ft (11.3 m).</kw></p>
    <p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">Port Purcell Wharf, which is 800 ft (244 m) long and has a depth alongside of 22 ft (6.7 m), can accommodate vessels with a maximum draft of 21 ft (6.4 m). The cargo dock at Port Purcell is equipped with adequate space for the efficient handling of the containerized cargo, as well as the traditional (break bulk) cargo. Although Navy or Coast Guard ships now usually tie up at the Cruise Ship Pier, Navy ships such as the USS Saginaw (1188) have tied up previously at Port Purcell. </kw></p>
    <p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">Vessels with drafts of less than 6.6 ft (2 m) can use the Road Town Jetty. </kw></p>
    <p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">Large vessels can anchor in position 18°25.67'N 64°32.25'W in the bay south of Beef Island. This anchorage is exposed to winds from the south and southeast and sudden and heavy rainsqualls sweeping into the bay may cause a vessel to drag anchor.</kw></p>
    <p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">Other deep-draft vessels anchor in depths of 48-72 ft (14.6-21.9 m) inside Scotch and Lark Banks. Anchorage may also be obtained in the north part of the Harbor, north of Harbor Rock, in about 48 ft (14.6 m). Vessels proceeding to the deep-draft anchorage should steer 321º from a point about 180º from Half Moon Point until the lighted buoy off Burt Point is abeam. Ships desiring to make the north anchorage should proceed as to the deep-draft anchorage until the Commissioner’s House is abeam. Ships desiring to anchor south of Harbor Spit should proceed up the principal channel between Scotch Bank and Lark Bank until the range lights come in line 290º, which will lead to a depth of about 54 ft (16.5 m) between Burt Point and Harbor Spit. The best berth is just south of the range light.</kw></p>
    <p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">Road Harbor has a number of yacht marinas that can best be seen on the chart. There is a small craft jetty adjacent to Road Town, with depths of 2 to 9.8 ft (0.6 to 3 m) alongside. The Road Town Jetty is used as a ferryboat landing as well as a small boat landing (Fleet Landing) for any Navy or Coast Guard ships at anchorage. </kw></p>
    <p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">With the exception of ships supplying oil, ships awaiting embarkation of a pilot, and ships anchored while under pilotage, anchorage is prohibited in an area best seen on NGA Chart # 25611.</kw></p>
    <p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">Oil and gas submarine pipelines extend into the Harbor from the east side of the bay, to terminal berths consisting of mooring buoys. The positions are best seen on the chart. </kw></p>
    <p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">Mooring buoys are privately owned and not available within the Port for large vessels. They are not normally used by Navy ships or commercial shipping.</kw></p>
    <p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">Sopers Hole (18°25.67'N 64°32.25'W), limited port of entry, is a basin lying between the west extremity of Tortola Island on the north, and Little Thatch Island and Frenchman Cay on the south. Sopers Hole affords good sheltered anchorage for small vessels.</kw></p>
    <p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">Depths of 75.5 ft (23 m), sandy bottom, are found in the middle of the basin north of Little Thatch Island, gradually decreasing to 36.1 ft (11 m) about 29.5 ft (9 m) from the shore on either side and to a lesser depth in the approach to the shoal area north of Frenchman Cay. Well up in the bight, the bottom is muddy, and provides better holding ground than in the middle.</kw></p>
    <p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">There is a ferry landing pier and a yacht marina at Sopers Hole. A light is exhibited at the southwest end of the landing pier.</kw></p>
    <p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">Guana Island (18°29'N 64°34'W) lies close off the northeast side of Tortola Island. A fairway passage between the two islands has a least depth of 28.9 ft (8.8 m). Good sheltered anchorage can be found, in 42.3 ft (12.9 m), in the entrance of White Bay, with the west extremity of the island bearing 347º and Monkey Point, the south extremity of the island bearing 112º. This anchorage should not be used during the period of the rollers.</kw></p>
    <p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">Great Camanoe (18°28'N 64°32'W) lies about 1 nmi east of Guana Island. The island consists of two parts connected by a low, narrow neck of land. Scrub Island lies close east of Great Camanoe Island. It is separated by a narrow channel in which there are many shoals and rocks. Little Camanoe Island and Marina Cay are west and east, respectively, of the south end of Great Camanoe Island. Submarine cables exist near the south side of Great Camanoe Island and can best be seen on the chart.</kw></p>
    <p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">Beef Island (18°26'N 64°32'W) lies about 0.5 nmi south of Great Camanoe Island and is separated from the east side of Tortola Island by a narrow and shoal passage. The south extremity of the island, marked by a light, is a prominent landmark. A bascule bridge connects Beef Island and Tortola Island. Good anchorage can be taken, in 78.7 ft (24 m), in the lee of Beef Island, about 0.7 nmi west of its south extremity. Buck Island lies about 2 nmi west of the south extremity of Beef Island.</kw></p>
    <p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">A small marine railway in Careening Cove can handle boats about 40 ft (12.2 m) in length and 6 ft (1.8 m) in draft. Another marine railway in Bauger Bay, on the northeast side of Road Harbor, can handle small boats of 6-ft (1.8-m) draft for repairs. No repair facilities are available for ship.</kw></p>
    <h3><font color="#0000ff"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-2-100">2.2 CHANNELS </kw></font></h3><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">
    
    Making the Virgin Islands from the north, Virgin Gorda (British) will be seen on the extreme left, rising in a clear, well-defined peak about 1,400 ft (427 m) high. Next to Virgin Gorda, Tortola (British) will appear as the most conspicuous. The highest mountain appears flat and elongated from the north but rises to an elevation of about 1,800 ft (549 m). Immediately west of Tortola will be seen the rugged, pointed peaks of Jost Van Dyke (British), rising to about 1,100 ft (335 ft), and behind them the irregular peaks rising from the tableland of St. John (U.S.) to heights of 800 to 1,300 ft (244 m to 396 m).
    
    </kw><p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">From about 20 nmi north of the islands, a separation will be observed between St. Thomas and St. John, but St. John, Jost Van Dyke, Tortola, and Virgin Gorda will appear to be one large island. St. Thomas is less rugged than the other islands but it may be recognized from its large midisland saddle that has horns nearly 1,600 ft (488 m) high. This saddle is equally conspicuous from the south.</kw></p>
    <p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">The British Virgin Islands are located on a bank, over which the depths are less than 656 ft (200 m), extending in an east-northeast direction for nearly 90 nmi from the end of Puerto Rico. Anegada is located close to the northeast extremity, but the remainder of the group lies near the edge of the bank.</kw></p>
    <p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">Numerous reports and surveys indicate that shoal patches of small extent may be encountered on the banks. Deep-draft vessels, especially those drawing over 39 ft (12 m) should remain outside the 328.1 ft (100 m) curve where possible.</kw></p>
    <p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">Vessels approaching the islands from the north should avoid the following banks:</kw></p>
    <p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-2-70">a. Whale Banks (18°28'N 64°32'W), with a least depth of 60.7 ft (18.5 m).</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-2-70">
      b. Turtle Head (18°28'N 64°32'W), with a least depth of 36.1 ft (11 m).</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-2-70">
      c. Barracouta Banks (18°28'N 64°32'W), with a least depth of 65.6 ft (20 m).</kw><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-2-70">
      d. Kingfish Banks (18°28'N 64°32'W), with a least depth of 47.6 ft (14.5 m).</kw></p>
    <p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">Saba Bank, Barracuda Bank, and the dangers extending east from St. Croix are the main dangers when approaching from south. </kw></p>
    <p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">Road Harbor (18°26'N 64°37'W), on the south coast of Tortola, lies in a bay that forms the natural harbor of the Island. The bay is protected by ranges of hills from all except south and southeast winds. Road Town, the capital of the British Virgin Islands, stands on the west shore of the bay.</kw></p>
    <p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">Todman Peak, 1,155 ft (352 m) in elevation, is prominent standing northwest of the Harbor, and Mount Bellevue, 1,263 ft (385 m) in elevation is also prominent standing northeast of the Harbor.</kw></p>
    <p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">There are several prominent landmarks in Road Town, these being Fort Burt Hotel, a group of four pink buildings, situated on the west side of the Harbor on Burt Point, the Administration Building (Customhouse), a white flat roofed building standing behind the main wharf, and about midway between these two positions stands the Administration Residence (Commissioner’s House), an isolated, white concrete building standing on a low knoll. To the north of the Administration Building, the white belfry of the Anglican Church shows above Wickham Cay, a low mangrove-covered islet, in the northwest part of the Harbor. On the east side of the bay, there are several conspicuous silver colored oil tanks on Shirley Point, 0.7 nmi northwest of Hogs Valley Point. At night, lights burn in their vicinity. North of the tanks a conspicuous radio mast, painted red and white, attains an elevation of 302 ft (92 m) with a shorter mast standing on a building close to the west.</kw></p>
    <p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">Little Wickam Cay, a small mangrove island lying in the northwest corner of the bay, in a basin formed by two reclaimed areas and the coast, is prominent. The entrance to the inlet is protected by breakwaters beyond which two marinas are prominent. </kw></p>
    <p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">From a position about 0.5 nmi south of the Bluff (18°26'N 64°31'W), a vessel should steer to pass similar distance southeast of Nora Hazel Point (3.2 nmi west-southwest) keeping clear of depths of 27.9 ft (8.5 m) about 1 nmi west and about 0.5 nmi south of the point.</kw></p>
    <p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">Then, the yellow dome of Fort Burt Hotel in line with the 951.5 ft (290 m) summit of the hill behind it, bearing 278º, will lead close aboard the 32.8 ft (10 m) contour off Hogs Valley Point. The dome is not easy to distinguish unless the sun is high.</kw></p>
    <p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">When 0.5 nmi off Burt Point course should be altered to northwest to pass between Scotch Bank and Lark Bank with either the extremity of the breakwater extending southwest from Wickham’s Cay 2 or the Cruise Ship Pier dolphin bearing 318º on Wickham’s Cay 1.</kw></p>
    <p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">When the conspicuous 301.9 ft (92 m) radio mast on the east side of the Harbor bears about 040º course may be altered north towards Port Purcell. The right hand edge of a long low turquoise-colored building on the quay, bearing 003º, will lead in a least depth of 22.3 ft (6.8 m) to the quay.</kw></p>
    <p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">It is reported that the position of the buoys in Road Harbor are unreliable owing to the poor holding ground and occasional strong winds and currents. </kw></p>
    <p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">It is usual for vessels to berth heading southeast turning on the starboard anchor. Tugs are not available and, after sunrise, the prevailing east winds may make berthing difficult. The pilot boat will assist with berthing lines.</kw></p>
    <p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-80">The depths in the approach to Road Harbor are very irregular. Within 1.5 nmi of Hogs Valley Point (Hog Point) and 2 nmi of Slaney Point there are many patches of rock and coral with depths of 13-36 ft (3.7 to 7 m).</kw></p>
    <p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">Depths of from 22-25 ft (6.7-7.6 m) will be found over extensive shoals with limits of about 1.1 nmi south of Hog Valley point and 1.1 nmi south of Slaney Point. A 17-ft (5.2-ft) patch is about 0.5 nmi southeast of Hog Valley Point, and an 18-ft (5.5-m) patch is about 0.75 nmi southwest of Slaney Point.</kw></p>
    <p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">A coral reef about 250 yards wide and partially covered by mangrove extends northeast from Slaney Point to Burt Point. A lighted buoy marks the outer limits of the reef at Burt point.</kw></p>
    
<p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">Denmark Banks, 0.5 nmi southeast of Burt point and marked by a lighted buoy, 
  has two rocky patches with a least depth of 13 ft (4 m). The Bluff, bearing 
  073º and open south of Nora Hazel Point, leads south of these banks.</kw></p>
    <p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">Lark Bank, 0.4 nmi east of Burt point, has a least depth of 15 ft (4.6 m) over a coral head. Scotch Bank, marked by a lighted buoy at its northwest edge, has a least depth of 10 ft (2.4 m) and lies on the east side of the entrance, west-northwest of Hogs Valley Point. The depths decrease rapidly towards the shore that is fringed by rock and coral.</kw></p>
    <p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">Harbor Spit, 0.4 nmi north of Burt point, is an extension of the shoal water in the northwest part of the Harbor. Depths on the spit are from 4-17 ft (1.2-5.2 m). A buoy marks the southeast end of the spit. Harbor Rock, 250 yards southeast from the end of the spit, has a least depth of 20 ft (6.1 m).</kw></p>
    <h3><font color="#0000ff"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-2-100">2.3 TUG AND PILOT AVAILABILITY</kw></font></h3><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">
