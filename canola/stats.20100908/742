Summary
</kw></p><p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">

This report describes the historical and cultural significance of Enset 
ventricosum - otherwise known as the False Banana. The long and laborous 
tasks of growing the plant for 6-9 years and of extracting the starchy 
foods is contrasted against the nutritive value of the products. It is 
proposed that the main reason for the culture of this crop is assurance 
of food for consumption following drought-induced crop losses. 
Considering the repeated problems of poverty, malnutrition, and disease 
in the Wolaita area of Southern Ethiopia, in spite of good soil and 
usually good rainfall, alternative crop and livestock programmes should 
be considered in conjunction with health and education programmes.

The role of Enset in the culture of Southern Ethiopia 
</kw></p><p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">

Early travelers to the Wolaita area of Southern Ethiopia were so 
impressed with the importance attached to the cultivation, harvest and 
preparation of enset foods that they labeled this `the Enset culture' or 
`the Enset people'. Certainly the presence of 20-40 magnificent 5-8 
metre high Enset plants framing the tukul and farmyard presents an 
impressive picture. Four to seven thousand years ago people in Ethiopia 
were largely hunters and gatherers who must have learned to use the 
fleshy interior of Enset during the dry season. About 700 years ago, 
with the coming of domesticated livestock, a settled culture evolved 
around the use of Enset products as a major and co-staple food. Today 
over 4 million people in Southern and South-Western Ethiopia depend on 
Enset foods but it is not widely grown or consumed any other place in 
the world.   
</kw></p><p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">

The elaborate process of husbandry and sequential transplanting of the 6 
to 9 year crop has been incorporated into various aspects of the culture 
of the Wolaita people. Pillot and Gires (1)  point out that the entire 
organization of the farmstead production system in the Wolaita area 
centers around the arada or Enset/coffee plantation and is a priority 
site for spreading manure accumulated from keeping cattle in the 
farmyard at night. The establishment of a new farmstead calls for a 
complicated process of slowly increasing the fertility of a new arada 
called a chouka in which manuring of annual crops (maize, potato and 
beans) is practiced. Following this, concentric rows of Enset are 
transplanted, the number depending on the size of the family and the 
expected needs for survival. An area in the middle is devoted to coffee 
which is protected from drying winds on three sides by Enset and the 
other by the tukul. New Enset plants come from the small nursery just 
behind the house which also contains sweet potatoes for cuttings, 
cabbage, pepper and herbs. Land use planners suggest that a more 
efficient layout would be achieved if Enset plants defined the periphery 
of the homestead but farmers attach great importance to keeping them 
close to the house.    The husbandry of Enset and preparation of foods 
derived from the plant requires several complicated and strenuous 
procedures which are assigned to specific members of the family 
according to their age and sex. Also, Enset foods are traditionally 
incorporated into cultural events such as births, deaths, weddings, and 
rites of planting, harvesting and purification. The starting of new 
shoots and transplantation is initiated by the male head of household. 
Cultivation, manuring and digging of the fermentation pits is done by 
juvenile males. The harvesting time and plant selection for harvest are 
controlled by the head of household. The younger women in the household 
remove the fleshy pseudostem (stalk or base) and leaf midribs for the 
strenuous task of extracting the pulp. The underground fermentation 
vessels are arranged, periodically checked and stirred, then declared 
finished under the supervision of the female head of the household.
</kw></p><p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-2-90">

The husbandry and production of Enset
</kw></p><p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">

The `corm' or juncture of root and stem of an old plant is cut into 
pieces and planted in the nursery, producing 50 to 200 new shoots. These 
are broken off and transplanted in rows using one square metre per plant 
for the next two years. New Enset plants are transplanted at least twice 
during the growth period in order to save space. After two years the 
plants are dug up, roots and leaves trimmed and transplanted into 2.25 
metre squares for the 3rd through 5th years. The final transplanting is 
to 9 metre squares again disturbing the roots and reducing the leaf area 
to minimize wilting. They remain in the squares for the 6th year until 
harvest which may be in the 7th to 9th year, depending upon the needs of 
the family. 
</kw></p><p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">

Throughout this time the soil is tilled for weeding and the 
incorporation of manure. The importance attached to the growing of Enset 
is seen by the clean weeding or mulching of the plantation. 
Intercropping the bare areas is not practiced but plantings may occur 
where individual plants are harvested or have died from disease or 
transplanting shock. Other than the nursery for starting plants, all the 
manure of the farm is incorporated into the Enset plantation. Soils in 
this area are inherently acidic, with heavy clays that retain high 
levels of organic matter when manured, and give good nitrogen fertility 
that would benefit further from liming and phophorus. 
</kw></p><p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">

Transplanting is usually done in the dry season due to the heavy nature 
of the soil which would turn into hard pieces if compacted under wet 
conditions. Nevertheless, considerable growing time is lost and the 
plants suffer wilting damage. Tigist Demake (2)  reported that averaged 
over four different varieties, the pseudostem length was 0.7 and 1.4 
metres shorter with 1 and 2 transplantings respectively as compared to 
direct planting of shoots. Research into the size of the hole for 
transplanting and the amount of root/leaf trimming was aimed at 
minimizing these stresses. Moist loose soil around the base and minimal 
leaf transpiration were found to be advantageous to rooting 
establishment of transplants. 
</kw></p><p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">

Enset ventricosum is the edible species of the separate genus of the 
banana family, thus named `false banana' but the Enset fruit is not 
edible. Considerable variation exists within the species for growth and 
adaptational characters. Leaf colors vary from pale yellow-green to 
purple-brown, dark green leaves with purple midribs being the most 
common. There also is considerable adaptational differences due to 
altitude and moisture regime. The Institute of Agriculture Research at 
Areke in Wolaita has collected over 200 clones mostly named after the 
village where they were cultivated, and giving an indication of 
ecological adaptation. For instance, farmers in the Sawla area were not 
growing Enset until FAO introduced a clone variety well adapted  to the 
lowlands.
</kw></p><p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-2-90">

Enset processing and foods
</kw></p><p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">

Upon harvesting the pseudostem is extracted and cut into 30 x 20 cm 
pieces which are called Chafina. The quality of the chafina may be 
affected by age and maturity of the plant as well as the quantity of the 
leaf midrib tissue included. This quality determines the proportion of 
the three derived foods Boula, Oude, and Wassa. The three usually occur 
in a decreasing order of quality and increasing quantity. 
</kw></p><p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">

The women decort (remove much of the fibre) by fine chopping and grating 
the Chafina on a special wide wooden board, collecting the pulpy white 
juice below. When it reaches the consistency of fresh cheese it is 
pressed through a 30 x 50 cm conical wooden sieve to become Kintcho or 
Kocho which is evaporated to form a thick paste. 
</kw></p><p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">

According to the expected time of harvest, the most respected woman in 
the household prepares in advance the yeast starter or fermentation 
infusion called Gamantho from a chopped rhizome and the family's own 
culture of yeast. These cultures are highly prized secrets and give 
varying tastes that is characteristic to the family. The starter is 
wrapped in Enset leaves, stirred and warmed in the sun every 5 days, and 
allowed to ferment 15-20 days depending upon the air temperature.
</kw></p><p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">

When the Kintcho is prepared, the men dig a hole about 3 metres deep and 
2 metres in diameter filling the bottom metre with stones for drainage. 
A bamboo cylinder called a Kafitcho, 2 metres long and 1.5 metres in 
diameter is inserted and lined with Enset leaves. The women put in the 
Kintcho paste, add the yeast starter and mix or kneed it well with their 
feet, packing it somewhat with the water coming to the top. Some leaves 
are put on top, a board and some heavy stones are placed over it to 
force the water out between the bamboos as the fermentation proceeds. 
Every five days, for approximately 25 days, the women uncover and stir 
it trying to rotate the top to the bottom as it becomes gradually 
floury. An oval cake is formed, dried in the sun, and aged another 20 
days before being ready to eat.
</kw></p><p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">

According to their daily needs, several kilogrammes are cut off  the 
cake, chopped and worked into a powder to remove remaining fibres. 
Before cooking, the flour is soaked several times in water or milk with 
the liquid and floating pulp pieces being poured off.
</kw></p><p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">

Food prepared from Enset include bread, ferfer (a type of flat bread or 
injera) and porridge which may contain meat and/or vegetables. It is 
even possible to prepare alcoholic or non- alcoholic drinks. The best 
quality Boula or Oude is made into thin crepes and rolled up. When 
plants of poor quality are harvested, the hardest part of the rhizome is 
chopped fine, mixed with yeast and fermented for three days. Called 
Obobie, it may be boiled with vegetables and spices but should be eaten 
within three days. All the above mentioned are energy food with little 
protein content (See next section).
</kw></p><p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-2-90">

Enset productivity and yields
</kw></p><p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">

The yield of fermented product per plant is high but must be considered 
on a per hectare per year basis. Taye Bezuneh (3) reported that 40 
months after a single transplanting, the yield of three clones planted 
in 5 metre squares or 2000 plants/hectare varied from 18.5 to 29.8 
kg/plant which he translates into 7,414 to 11,950 kg/ha/year on a 
farmer's basis of a five year growing period. This interpretation 
evidently assumes that the same yield measured in 40 months would be 
equivalent to the farmer's yield in five years of commonly practiced 
culture. The protein content decreases from 1.2% in the raw Kocho to 
0.25% in the processed Boula while the carbohydrate content increases 
from 41.3% to 54.4%.
</kw></p><p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">

However, Pillot and Gires, comparing the usual farming practice to maize 
growing, give the following figures. The interior pseudostem and leaf 
midribs of one plant give about 130 kg of green matter which is reduced 
to 84 kg by hulling, 52 kg by fermentation and finally to 31 kg of 
edible product by refining. At 1 metre2 the first 2 years, 2.225 the 
next 3 years and 9 metres2 the last 2 years, it gives a total land use 
of 26.75 metres2 or 374 plants per hectare. This is reduced to 275 
plants by transplanting loss and Bacterial Wilt Disease so that 275 
plants/ha x 31 kg/plant give 3,500 kg/ha @ 1650 calories/kg represents 
14,000 kcal/ha. Maize yielding 40 quintals at 3,500 Kcal/kg will give an 
equivalent 14,000 kcal/ha in a 6 month growing season. Also the maize at 
380 kg/ha of protein is much superior to the 25-50 kg/ha produced by the 
Enset crop.
</kw></p><p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">

Considering the manuring and the rainfall of the Enset growing area, 
4,000 kgs/ha is not an unlikely yield, and so the main reason for 
growing Enset is likely to be food security or food reserved against 
other crop failures. 
</kw></p><p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-2-90">

Enset research and needs for the future
</kw></p><p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">

The first National Conference on Enset was held at the Institute of 
Agricultural Research, 12-15 December 1994, covering many topics 
including research. Research activities and needs focussed on: (1) Agro-
botanical investigations including collection, classification and 
selection of clones with superior characteristics, including bacterial 
wilt resistance, to standardize materials for further research. (2) 
Enset based farming systems research to improved production methods and 
fertility (Nitrogen and Phosphorus). (3) Processing and utilization 
techniques to improve the nutritive value of the fermentation product 
including mixing with teff to make injera and selection of clones and 
processes to increase protein content. (4) Socio-economic research into 
the viability and adaptability of the Enset culture through 
intensification of cultivation and greater self-exploitation which is 
now threatening the stability of the system itself. 
</kw></p><p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3-100">

One person described the Wolaita area as a `museum of domesticated 
plants, animals and their diseases'. The question for the future is what 
are the root causes of recurrent poverty, malnutrition, and disease in 
this land of the `wonder plant'. With consideration to those promoting 
the maintenance of crop diversity, there is a need to be open-minded and 
realistic about the present food requirements of the Wolaita people. Can 
the Enset culture system be relied upon to properly feed the fast 
growing local population? The answer probably includes the introduction 
of new crops, especially co-staples and protein sources for weaned 
children, as well as improvements in Enset varieties, culture, and 
processing. The future of Wolaita is not as a museum of past practices 
but is present in the nurseries of tree seedlings, variety trials, new 
ideas and newborn farmers.
