<p><font color="#ffffff" size="6"><strong><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">It is one of the most
amazing prophecies in the Bible. It is most specific, describing
historical events, up to the present, in more detail than any
other prophecy. It is the longest prophecy in the Bible. It is
found in Daniel, chapter 11. It describes the impending war! The
prelude is found in the 10th chapter of the book of Daniel. The
prophecy came to Daniel in the third year of the reign of Cyrus,
king of the Persian Empire (Dan. 10:1). A "man,"
apparently the archangel Gabriel (Dan. 9:21), appears before
Daniel, to make him understand what shall befall God's people in
these present "latter days" (10:14). </kw></strong></font></p>

<p><font color="#ffffff" size="6"><strong><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">The "King of the
North" and the "King of the South" The first verse
of the 11th chapter is a continuation from the last verse of the
10th chapter. The angel says to Daniel, "Behold, there shall
stand up yet three kings in Persia; and the fourth shall be far
richer than they all: and by his strength through his riches he
shall stir up all against the realm of Grecia. And a mighty king
shall stand up, that shall rule with great dominion, and do
according to his will" (Dan. 11:2-3). Actually there were 12
more kings in the Persian Empire, but only the first four
following Cyrus were of importance for the purpose of this
prophecy. They were Cambyses, pseudo-Smerdis, Darius and Xerxes.
It was the last, or Xerxes, who was the richest of all and
stirred up war with Greece. Then King Philip of Macedonia planned
a great war to conquer the Persian Empire, with an army made up
mostly of Grecians. He died before the plans were completed. But
his son, Alexander the Great, took over his plans, and invaded
Persia. He met the Persian army at the Battle of Issus, 333 B.C.
(Dan. 8:2, 5-6). Then he swept down into Egypt, and then to a
final crushing defeat of the Persian Empire at the Battle of
Arbella, 331 B.C., after which Alexander marched on a conquest
clear to India, sweeping all before him. Notice now verse 4 of
the prophecy: "And when he shall stand up, his kingdom shall
be broken, and shall be divided toward the four winds of heaven;
and not to his posterity, nor according to his dominion which he
ruled: for his kingdom shall be plucked up, even for others
beside those." </kw></strong></font></p>

<p><font color="#ffffff" size="6"><strong><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">How marvelously —
how accurately — that came to pass. We quote from one of the
authoritative English-language histories published in the last
century, A Manual of Ancient History (Student Series) by
Rawlinson: "Cut off unexpectedly in the vigor of early
manhood [the 33rd year of his age, June, 323 B.C.], he
[Alexander] left no inheritor, either of his power or of his
projects" (p. 237). The Empire was left leaderless and in
confusion, but out of this emerged, by the year 301 B.C., four
divisions, just as prophesied, as a result of a division of the
Empire into four divisions by Alexander's generals. They were: 1.
Ptolemy (Soter), ruling Egypt, part of Syria and Judea. 2.
Seleucus (Nicator), ruling Syria, Babylonia and territory east to
India. 3. Lysimachus, ruling Asia Minor. 4. Cassander, ruling
Greece and Macedonia. Thus was the prophecy of verse 4 fulfilled
to the letter. Now notice what follows. From here the prophecy
foretells the activities only of two of these four divisions:
Egypt, called "king of the south," because it is south
of Jerusalem; and the Syrian kingdom, the king of the north, just
north of Judea. It is because the Holy Land passed back and forth
between those two divisions, and because their different wars
were principally over possession of Judea, that the prophecy is
concerned with them. Here is verse 5: "And the king of the
south [Egypt] shall be strong, and one of his princes; and he
shall be strong above him, and have dominion; his dominion shall
be a great dominion." In history, we learn that the original
Ptolemy I, called Soter, became strong and powerful, developing
Egypt beyond the greatest dreams of Alexander. One of his
princes, or generals, Seleucus Nicator, also became strong and
powerful. And, in 312 B.C., taking advantage of Ptolemy's being
tied up in a war, he established himself in Syria, and assumed
the diadem as king. Verse 6 says, "And in the end of years
they shall join themselves together; for the king's daughter of
the south shall come to the king of the north to make an
agreement [margin, "rights" or "equitable
conditions," or "marriage union"]: but she shall
not retain the power of the arm; neither shall he stand, nor his
arm: but she shall be given up, and they that brought her, and he
that begat her, and he that strengthened her in these
times." </kw></strong></font></p>

<p><font color="#ffffff" size="6"><strong><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">Fulfilled to the
Letter! At the end of 50 years, this occurred exactly as
described! Syria's ruler, the king of the north, at this time was
Antiochus II, called Theos. His wife was named Laodice. And, says
Rawlinson's Ancient History, page 251, "Her influence ...
engaged him in a war with Ptolemy Philadelphus [king of the
south], B.C. 260, which is terminated, B.C. 252, by a marriage
between Antiochus and Bernice, Ptolemy's daughter." The
prophecy says "he that begat her" shall be given up.
Also that she shall not retain the power of the arm, neither
shall the king of the north, whom she married, stand. All three
are to come to their end. Notice how accurately this came to
pass. Says Rawlinson's History, pages 251 and 252: "On the
death of Philadelphus [he that begat her], B.C. 247, Antiochus
repudiated Bernice, and took back his former wife, Laodice, who,
however, doubtful of his constancy, murdered him to secure the
throne for her son Seleucus (II) B.C. 246 ... Bernice ... had
been put to death by Laodice." Nowhere in all the Bible is
there so literal a prophecy, giving so many details of future
history. And to read an ancient history of these kingdoms is
simply to see unfolded before your eyes, step by step, verse by
verse, this marvelous prophecy. There can be no doubt of its
right application! </kw></strong></font></p>

<p><font color="#ffffff" size="6"><strong><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">The Holy Land Changes
Hands Next let us notice verse 7: "But out of a branch of
her roots shall one stand up in his estate [margin, "in his
office"], which shall come with an army, and shall enter
into the fortress of the king of the north, and shall deal
against them, and shall prevail." "Out of a
branch," or "shoot," of her roots. Her parents
were her roots. Hence, this must be her brother, who next should
occupy the throne of king of the south and fulfill this prophecy.
Now listen to this accurate fulfillment, quoted word for word
from the same page of Rawlinson's work (p. 252): "Ptolemy
Euergetes [the III, eldest son of Philadelphus (p. 272) and
therefore Bernice's brother, a branch of her roots] invaded
Syria, B.C. 245, to avenge the murder of his sister, Bernice ...
.In the war which followed, he carried everything before
him." The eighth verse of Daniel 11 says this king of the
south would carry captives and vessels of silver and gold into
Egypt, and continue to reign more years than the king of the
north, who at that time was Seleucus II, and verse 9 says he
shall return into Egypt. As verse 7 said he should "enter
into the fortress of the king of the north," Ptolemy III did
seize the fortress of Syria, Seleucia, the port of Antioch,
capital of the kingdom! Then he carried back to Egypt immense
booty and 2,500 molten images and idolatrous vessels which, in
526 B.C. Cambyses had carried away from Egypt. He continued to
rule until 222 B.C., while the king of the north, Seleucus II,
died in 226 B.C. When he died, his two sons took over the kingdom
of the north; first Seleucus III, 226-223 B.C., who ruled only
three years, and then his brother Antiochus III, called "the
Great," 223-187 B.C. Both of these two sons of Seleucus II
assembled immense forces to war against Egypt, avenge their
father, and recover their port and fortress, Seleucia. And this
was accurately prophesied in verse 10: "But his sons shall
be stirred up, and shall assemble a multitude of great forces:
and one shall certainly come, and overflow, and pass through:
then shall he return and be stirred up [margin, "be stirred
up again"], even to his fortress." "And,"
continues verse 11, "the king of the south shall be moved
with choler, and shall come forth and fight with him, even with
the king of the north: and he shall set forth a great multitude;
but the multitude shall be given into his hand." In
fulfillment of the latter part of verse 10, Antiochus the Great,
after 27 years, recovered his fortress, Seleucia, and he also
conquered the territory of Syria, as far as Gaza, including
Judea. But the young Egyptian king, now Ptolemy IV (Philopater),
was roused, and with an army of 20,000 inflicted severe defeat on
Antiochus the Great; and fulfilling verse 12, he killed tens of
thousands and again annexed Judea to Egypt. But he was not
strengthened, for he made a rash and speedy peace with Antiochus,
and returned to dissipation, throwing away the fruits of victory.
Says verse 12, "And when he hath taken away the multitude,
his heart shall be lifted up; and he shall cast down many ten
thousands: but he shall not be strengthened by it."
"For," as verse 13 continues, "the king of the
north shall return, and shall set forth a multitude greater than
the former, and shall certainly come after certain years with a
great army and with much riches." It was "after certain
years," or 12 years later, 205 B.C., that Ptolemy Philopator
died, leaving his throne to an infant son, Ptolemy Epiphanes.
Then Antiochus assembled a greater army, and won great victories.
He then made a treaty allying Philip of Macedonia with him, and
others, against Egypt, and they wrested Phoenicia and southern
Syria from the king of the south. In this they were assisted by
some of the Jews. Josephus' Jewish history says many Jews helped
Antiochus. But notice how accurately Almighty God had foretold
this, hundreds of years before it happened! — "And in
those times there shall many stand up against the king of the
south: also the robbers of thy people shall exalt themselves to
establish the vision; but they shall fall" (v. 14). </kw></strong></font></p>

<p><font color="#ffffff" size="6"><strong><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">Read It in Your Own
Bible! To save space, the reader is asked from this point to read
each verse of the prophecy from his own Bible, thus saving us
reprinting the prophecy in full here. We give here only the facts
in history. Verses 15-16 — "the glorious land," of
course, refers to Judea, the Holy Land. Antiochus the Great
besieged and took Sidon from Egypt, ruined the interests of Egypt
in Judea at the Battle of Mount Panium, 198 B.C., and then
Antiochus took possession of Judea. Verse 17 — "upright
ones" (see margin) in Hebrew means "equal conditions,
or marriage," but the one he marries will not stand on his
side. In 198 B.C., Antiochus arranged a marriage between his
daughter, Cleopatra (not the Cleopatra of 31 B.C. in Egypt) and
young Ptolemy Epiphanes, king of the south, by which he hoped
subtly to gain complete possession of Egypt; but the plan failed.
Says Rawlinson, page 254, "Coele-Syria and Palestine
promised as a dowry, but not delivered." Cleopatra did not
truly stand on the side of Antiochus, for it was only a trick to
gain possession of Egypt. Verse 18 — and so Antiochus turned
his attention in another direction and tried to conquer, 197 to
196 B.C., the islands and coasts of Asia Minor. But the Roman
general, Lucius Cornelius Scipio Asiaticus, utterly defeated him
at the Battle of Magnesia, 190 B.C. Verse 19 — Antiochus
next turned his attention to the fortresses of his own land, in
the east and west. But, attempting to recruit his dissipated
wealth by the plunder of the Oriental Temple of Belus, in
Elymais, he was killed, 187 B.C. Verse 20 — Seleucus IV
Philopator (187-176), his son, in an effort to raise money, sent
a tax collector, Heliodorus, through Judea. But he reigned only
11 years, when Heliodorus poisoned him. Verse 21 — he left
no heir. But his brother, a younger son of Antiochus the Great,
named Epiphanes (Antiochus IV), a contemptible reprobate, came by
surprise and through flattery took the kingdom. To his aid came
his assistant, Eumenes. Rawlinson says, page 255, "Antiochus
[Epiphanes], assisted by Eumenes, drives out Heliodorus, and
obtains the throne, B.C. 176. He astonishes his subjects by an
affectation of Roman manners" and "good-natured
profuseness [flattery]." </kw></strong></font></p>

<p><font color="#ffffff" size="6"><strong><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">Antiochus Epiphanes
Verse 22 — "the prince of the covenant" does not
refer to Christ. This was the attempt of Antiochus to replace the
Jewish high priest by another who would be subservient to him.
Verses 23-24 — although only a few were with him at first,
yet by this "Roman manner," by deceit and flattery, he
crept into power and prospered. He also invaded Galilee and Lower
Egypt. His fathers, the former kings of Syria, had favored the
Jews, but says Rawlinson, page 255, they "were driven to
desperation by the mad project of this self-willed monarch."
Verse 25 — Rawlinson, pages 255-256, says, "Threatened
with war by the ministers of Ptolemy Philometor [now king of the
south], who claim Coele-Syria and Palestine as the dowry of
Cleopatra, the late queen-mother, Antiochus marches against Egypt
... B.C. 171" (pp. 277-278). But he was met by his nephew,
Ptolemy Philometor, king of the south, with another immense army.
But the Egyptian king was defeated through the treachery of his
own officers and was outwitted by Antiochus. Verses 26-27 —
continuing in Rawlinson, page 278: "After his victory at
Pelusium, Antiochus advanced to Memphis, and having obtained
possession of the young king's person [Ptolemy Philometor, king
of the south], endeavored to use him as a tool for effecting the
entire reduction of the country." In 174 B.C., the uncle of
the king of the south sat at a banquet. Antiochus pretended to
ally himself with the young Ptolemy, against his brother,
Euergetes II, but each was trying to deceive the other. </kw></strong></font></p>

<p><font color="#ffffff" size="6"><strong><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">The Abomination of
Desolation Verse 28 — in 168 B.C., returning from Egypt with
great plunder, Antiochus set himself against the Jews, massacred
many, and then returned to Antioch with golden vessels from the
Temple at Jerusalem. Verse 29 — the same year, he again
invaded Egypt, but with none of his former success, because
Philometor, king of the south, got help from Rome. Verse 30
— the Roman fleet came against Antiochus, he was forced to
surrender to the terms of Popillius, commander of the Roman
fleet, and retire from Egypt and restore Cyprus to Egypt.
Returning through Judea, smarting under the defeat, he vented his
exasperation against the Jews, and extended special favors to
those Jews who would turn from their religion. Verse 31 —
then, 167 B.C., the next year, came the climax of the horror.
Antiochus sent troops to the Holy Land, who desecrated the Temple
and sanctuary, abolished the daily sacrifice (see also Daniel
8:11, 24) and (Kislev 15, Hebrew calendar) placed the abomination
— an image — on the altar in the Temple precincts,
making it desolate (Rawlinson, p. 255). Many who claim to teach
the Bible try to apply the prophecy of this verse to Moslems in
the 7th century A.D., building the Dome of the Rock on the
supposed site of the ancient Temple at Jerusalem! But every verse
of this prophecy, step by step, verse by verse, unfolded in
actual history, just as here recounted, so there can be not the
slightest shadow of doubt as to this abomination that
"maketh desolate" — it was an idol set up in 167
B.C., by Antiochus Epiphanes. </kw></strong></font></p>

<p><font color="#ffffff" size="6"><strong><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">The Prophecy Comes to
Christ and the Apostles Verse 32 — Antiochus tried to end
the religion of the Jews. He took away the daily sacrifice,
forbade the ministration at the Temple. He perverted by
flatteries the Jews who were willing to forsake their religion.
But — right here, the prophecy cuts off from the
continuation of events in the history of those ancient north and
south kingdoms. Up to this point, the prophecy was unfolded, step
by step, in the actual history of the northern kingdom of the
Seleucidae, or Syria, and the southern kingdom of Egypt. But, say
most commentaries, all accurate details seem suddenly to stop
short with this verse. Now let us notice verse 32 in detail, and
particularly the last part: "And such as do wickedly against
the covenant shall he corrupt by flatteries." This,
Antiochus Epiphanes did do. But now notice the last part of the
verse: "but the people that do know their God shall be
strong, and do exploits." So our question now is, when,
beginning with, and following, 167 B.C., did people begin to know
God, and to be spiritually strong, and to do exploits in the
Lord's service? The answer is, at the time of the Maccabees,
beginning in 166 B.C., and, two centuries later, at the first
appearing of Jesus Christ and in the days of the apostles! Verse
33 — "And they that understand among the people shall
instruct many: yet they shall fall by the sword, and by flame, by
captivity, and by spoil, many days." Jesus and the apostles
did instruct many. But Jesus was put to death, and history
indicates that all the early apostles were martyred, except John.
And this continued, many days, even into the Middle Ages, when
millions were martyred for their faith. Verse 34 — "Now
when they shall fall, they shall be holpen with a little help:
but many shall cleave to them with flatteries. And [verse 35]
some of them of understanding shall fall, to try them, and to
purge, and to make them white, even to the time of the end:
because it is yet for a time appointed." Here is described
in general the whole course of God's people, from the days of
Christ to the present. Compare with such passages as Rev. 12:6,
11, 13-17. And notice the vision carries on down to this present
time of the end. Verse 36 — The king of the north — who
is he, now, in the early and middle New Testament times, to which
our prophecy has come? In 65 B.C., Syria was swallowed up by the
Roman Empire, and became a Roman province. The Roman emperor now
controlled Judea, and therefore the king of the north, here
referred to, is, at this time, the emperor of the Roman Empire.
This verse says he should do according to his will, and he did
— exalt himself, and magnify himself above every god, and he
did; for the Roman emperors required all to worship them and
sacrifice to them, as a god. He was as a god. He was to speak
against the true God, and he did and persecuted all Christians.
Verse 37 — his fathers had worshiped idols, but the Roman
emperors set themselves up as gods. Verse 38 — the Roman
emperors honored the god of forces, or (margin) munitions, and
developed the greatest war-making power the world ever knew.
"And a god whom his fathers knew not shall he honour with
gold, and silver, and with precious stones, and pleasant
things." After setting themselves up as gods, before A.D.
476, the emperors who followed, beginning with Justinian, A.D.
554, began to honor with gold, silver and power a god in a high
religious office never known to their fathers. (Compare this
prophecy of Daniel with Revelation 17:4, 5, and 18:3, 16.) Verse
39 — the emperors did acknowledge the supremacy of religion,
increased it with material glory and caused it to rule over many.

Present Now we come to the very present century. Verse 40 —
"And at the time of the end shall the king of the south push
at him ...." Who is today the "king of the south"?
It cannot be the king of Egypt, for in 31 B.C. Egypt became a
province of the Roman Empire, swallowed up by the king of the
north. Today Egypt is a republic ruled by native Arabs. It has no
king of its own. But, in the reign of Ptolemy III Euergetes
(verse 7), 247-222 B.C., Egypt annexed part of Ethiopia,
immediately south of Egypt (Rawlinson, pp. 272, 273). Since that
time, the 11th edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica says
(article "Ethiopia") Egypt and Ethiopia were two or
three times under the same government. Thus, the two were as one
land. And the only portion of that land of the "king of the
south" that remained independent until the 20th century is
Ethiopia! </kw></strong></font></p>

<p><font color="#ffffff" size="6"><strong><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">Ethiopia, the King of
the South Ethiopia was the only country in all East Africa that
continued independent, and had a government and kingdom dating
back before the Roman Empire. It was the southern part of the
kingdom of the south. So it is the only possible government that
could be the king of the south. At the time of the end — our
time — this king of the south was to push at the king of the
north, now at Rome! In 1895 King Menelik, of Ethiopia, sent an
army of 9,000 to 10,000 men against General Baratieri's Italian
army. North of Ethiopia was Eritrea, belonging to Italy. And
southeast was Italian Somaliland. In 1896 General Baratieri with
13,000 men tried to defend Eritrea against the Ethiopians. They
lost 4,600 whites and 3,000 native troops, and more than 3,500
were taken prisoner. In a later engagement the Italians were cut
to pieces because of their inexperience in fighting in
mountainous country and because they were greatly outnumbered.
This defeat was disastrous to Italian expansion in Africa. Ever
since, Italy demanded revenge! In 1927 Mussolini set the time, at
just 40 years from that defeat, or 1935, when he would be ready
"finally to make our voice heard, and see our rights
recognized!" 1935 came. The hour struck! Mussolini attacked!
Now notice verse 40: "... and the king of the north shall
come against him like a whirlwind, with chariots, and with
horsemen, and with many ships; and he shall enter into the
countries, and shall overflow and pass over." A whirlwind
comes in the air, sweeping all before it. Mussolini did send a
great air force into Africa! Also many modern
"chariots" — trucks, tanks, etc. — and ships,
loaded with soldiers. More than 100,000 sailed to Ethiopia. And,
notice it, Mussolini's forces were to pass over — in the
air! It is at this precise point in this astounding prophecy that
Mussolini's struggle in Ethiopia and in World War II ended.
Mussolini did not finish the prophecy. There is yet another
leader to arise in Europe! Notice what will next happen! Verse 41
— "He shall enter also into the glorious land ...
" — the Holy Land. This is yet to be fulfilled. When
the coming revival of the Roman Empire takes the Holy Land, then
the nations will be plunged into the initial phase of the great,
last and final crisis at the close of this age! Other prophecies
reveal that this revival of the Roman Empire will bring into
subjection the U.S. and Britain! (Request our free book The
United States and Britain in Prophecy.) "And,"
continues verse 41, "many countries shall be overthrown: but
these shall escape out of his hand, even Edom, and Moab, and the
chief of the children of Ammon" — the modern land of
the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. The coming dictator will unite
many others with him — 10 in all (Rev. 17:12) —
reviving the ancient Roman Empire. Verse 42 says Egypt shall not
escape, proving Egypt is not now the "king of the
south." Verse 43 says the Libyans and Ethiopians (observe
that after its conquest by Mussolini, Ethiopia is not again
referred to as the king of the south) shall be at his steps
— and he will then control them. Italy lost control of Libya
and Ethiopia after the war. Verse 44 — but news out of the
east and out of the north — Russia and the Orient —
shall trouble the revived Roman Empire. Russia will enter the
war! Verse 45 — the coming Roman Empire shall establish its
palace, as capital of the revived Roman Empire, and eventually
its religious headquarters, at Jerusalem! Zechariah 14:2 says the
city shall be taken! "Yet he shall come to his end, and none
shall help him"! This language signifies the end of the
"beast" and the "false prophet" at the hand
of God! You will find this end described in Revelation 19:19-20
and Zechariah 14:12. And now what is the time of this end, at the
close of this marvelous prophecy? The next verse, Daniel 12:1,
says at the time of the resurrection of the just — at the
Second Coming of Jesus Christ! This prophecy begins with the
kingdoms of Syria and Egypt, soon after the death of Alexander
the Great — 2,300 years ago. But it ends at the time of the
resurrection and the Second Coming of Christ to bring peace at
last to the region — and to the entire world! It is so
plain, there can be no doubt of its right application! Are you
ready for that event? It is fast approaching. Now is the time to
get ready, for Jesus said, "Be ye also ready"! . . . </kw></strong></font></p>
