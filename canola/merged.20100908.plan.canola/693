							<li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">immediately faced with a number of threats:
							</kw><ul>
								<li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">Hellenic confederacy states, Thracians, Illyrians all saw in Philip's death the opportunity for shaking off the yoke of Macedonia
								</kw></li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">Rival claimant to the throne: Philip had an infant son by the neice of his general Attalus

								<li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">Thessalians held Tempe pass, so Alexander carved out a new pass along Mt. Ossa along the coast
								</kw></li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">Once they were flanked, the Thessalians quickly conceded to Alexander, as did all the other states as he marched further south with his army, with no boodshed
								</kw></li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">At Corinth, the confederates elected him general in his father's place

							</kw><ul>
								<li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">Darius, who took the Persian throne in 336, is sending overtures and subsidies to the Greek cities in the hope of getting them to revolt, to keep Alexander busy in Europe

							<li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">Having settled Greece, Illyria, and Thrace, Alexander is now ready to pick up where his father had left off
							</kw></li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">Spent the winter 335-334 making military preparations and setting the affairs of Macedonia in order
							</kw></li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">Alexander's original intent:
							</kw><ul>
								<li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">liberate cities of Asia Minor?
								</kw></li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">Conquer all of Persia?
							</kw></li></ul>

								<li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">32,000 infantry, plus ca. 8,000 already in Asia

							</kw></li></ul>
							</li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">Alexander's Immediate concerns:
							</kw><ul>
								<li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">fleet not big enough to deal with the Persian fleet at sea, so Alexander has to disable it by concentrating first on the coast and securing all potential Persian naval bases
								</kw></li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">an army this large (plus ship crews totalling c. 36,000) has to be fed and paid, and their going to have to live off the land their in, so it's important for Alexander to begin his conquests rapidly
							</kw></li></ul>
							</li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">Visit to Troy

						<ul>
							<li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">Memnon, the commander of the Greek mercenaries working for Persia, wants to avoid battle with the Macedonian infantry, advocated a scorched-earth policy to deny Alexander the opportunity to support his troops
							</kw></li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">But the Persian satraps don't want to do this, decide to meet Alexander's army
							</kw></li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">Persians took up a position at the Granicus river, at a stteply-banked point
							</kw></li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">Alexander, on the third day after his army had crossed the Hellespont, went forward to meet them
							</kw><ul>
								<li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">had with him 13,000 infantry and 5,000 cavalry
								</kw></li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">scouts reported that the Persian forces were deployed along the river, with the cavalry on the bank stretching about a mile and a half, with the Greek mercenaries deployed behind them, on higher ground, in phalanx formation
							</kw></li></ul>
							</li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">Alexander's forces deployed from marching column into fighting formation as they approached, with cavalry on both wings of the infantry
							</kw></li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">Alexander extended his line to avoid being outflanked by the Persians
							</kw><ul>
								<li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">Placed left half under Parmenio's command, commanded the right himself
								</kw></li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">sent special cavalry squadron, with supporting infantry, from his center right charging into center of the Persian line
								</kw><ul>
									<li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">took heavy losses, but did its job of disrupting the Persian line, giving Alexander the opportunity he needed
									</kw></li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">Alexnader moved in with the Companion cavlary and broke through the Persian line
									</kw><ul>
										<li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">several Persian nobles tried to kill alexander, but he and his bodyguard repelled or killed them
									</kw></li></ul>
									</li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">with the breaking of the Persian center, the Persian wings fell back
								</kw></li></ul>
								</li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">Rather than pursue Persian cavalry, Alexander concentrated on the Greek mercenaries
								</kw><ul>
									<li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">sent cavalry upon their flanks and rear, attacked their center with his infantry
									</kw><ul>
										<li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">Greek mercenaries broke immediately, but were boxed in: only 2,000 taken prisoner, most of the rest slaughtered
									</kw></li></ul>
								</li></ul>
								</li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">Alexander's losses were only 150, most of them in the initial cavalry assault against the Persian center

						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">After Granicus</kw></p>
						<ul>
							<li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">In the wake of the battle, Alexander is able to move down the coast of Ionia and liberate the Greek cities with almost no resistance
							</kw><ul>
								<li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">Sardis, the main persian center in Asia Minor, fell without a fight
								</kw></li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">At Miletus, Persian fleet trapped Alexander's fleet in the harbor
								</kw><ul>
									<li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">Alexander siezes the water supply of the Persian fleet on the coast, forcing it to withdraw
								</kw></li></ul>
								</li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">in the wake of this, Alexander sent most of the fleet back to Greece, seeing it as more of a liability than an asset.
								</kw></li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">Persians agian tried to stop Alexander's advance at Halicarnassus, but he quickly took the city by storm.
								</kw></li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">Thus in one summer, Alexander had achieved his main alleged objectives, the liberation of the Ionian cities
							</kw></li></ul>
							</li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">333: Moves into central Asia Minor to secure his control over the coast
							</kw><ul>
								<li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">April: takes Gordium

									<li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">'Gordion knot': anyone who can untie it would rule Asia; Alexander cut it
								</kw></li></ul>
								</li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">Meanwhile Persian resistance in the area weakend with the death of Memnon; his replacement in July 333, another pharnabazus, doesn't do a whole lot
								</kw><ul>
									<li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">it would appear that Darius is intending at this point to moblize the full Persian army and take the offensive from the heart of the Persian empire
								</kw></li></ul>
								</li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">By end of summer 333 Alexander has moved down into Tarsus at the 'corner' of the Mediterranean, meeting some minor resistance at the pass of the 'Cilician Gates'
								</kw><ul>
									<li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">from here he can move down the coast of Syria and into Egypt, thus rendering the Persian fleet ineffective and protecting his rear as he moves east into Mesopotamia
								</kw></li></ul>
								</li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">Illness delays Alexander at Tarusus in August and September
								</kw><ul>
									<li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">by mid-October, Alexander knows of Darius' mobilization in Babylon
									</kw></li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">anxious to complete his siezure of the coast lest he get pinned in by the Persian fleet on the west and army on the east

						<p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">The Battle of Issus </kw><a href="Images/4.20/3_issus.jpg"><img src="Images/4.20/_3_issus.jpg" x-sas-useimagewidth="" x-sas-useimageheight="" align="bottom" height="62" width="96"></a></p>
						<ul>
							<li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">After recovering from his illness, Alexander ready to continue his campaigns
							</kw></li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">Sent Parmenio forward to occupy the Syrian gates, to the south
							</kw><ul>
								<li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">Topography of the region: Cilicia closed off on three sides by high mountain ranges
								</kw><ul>
									<li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">Taurus mountains to north and west; Alexander had come through the Taurus Cilician Gates to Tarsus
									</kw></li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">Amanus mountain range hems in the plain around the gulf of Issus to the east and south-east, with only a few narrow passes
									</kw></li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">Amanus range extends to the south of the plain, through which are a few good passes
								</kw></li></ul>
							</li></ul>
							</li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">According to Arrian, as he was mobilizing his army east of Tarsus, received word from Parmenio that Darius was encamped at Sochi, two days' march east of the Syrian gates
							</kw><ul>
								<li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">Alexnader hurried forward, hoping to engage Darius in a decisive battle
								</kw><ul>
									<li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">covered ca. 70 miles of rough terrain in two days to Alexandretta
									</kw></li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">then recieved the report that Darius was in his rear!
									</kw><ul>
										<li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">confirmed the report with a naval reconnaisance
									</kw></li></ul>
								</li></ul>
							</li></ul>
							</li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">An alternative account (Curtius) may be more likely:
							</kw><ul>
								<li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">Alexander knew of Darius' approach even while at Tarsus, but takes a defensive, rather than offensive posture:
								</kw><ul>
									<li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">moved south of Issus, where he held a war council:
									</kw><ul>
										<li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">Parmenio advised staying put
										</kw><ul>
											<li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">wait for reenfocements from Macedonia
											</kw></li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">better to fight within the narrow confines of the coastal plain than out in the open, since Daius will have the numerical superiority
										</kw></li></ul>
									</li></ul>
									</li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">Meanwhile, Darius is advised by his Greek mercenaries to withdraw into the wide plains of Mesopotamia, where he can use his numerical advantages, but Darius is anxious for a battle before the onset of winter; when it eventually became clear that Alexander wasn't going to leave the coastal plain, he decided to try to force the issue
									</kw><ul>
										<li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">enters Cilicia, captures Issus, and marches south to the Pinarus river
									</kw></li></ul>
									</li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">At this point Alexander receives word of Darius' position, and confirms it
								</kw></li></ul>
							</li></ul>
							</li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">Persian forces:
							</kw><ul>
								<li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">reported as between 300,000 and 600,000: obviously an exaggeration; 75,000-100,000, plus 20,000 cavalry moe likely?
							</kw></li></ul>
							</li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">Once Alexander has confirmed Darius' presence in his rear, he hastens to deal with it
							</kw><ul>
								<li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">Marched during the night to within several miles of the Pinarus
								</kw></li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">On the following morning, led the army forward in column, deployed into line of battle as they approached the river
								</kw><ul>
									<li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">difficult manouvers, since the plain widened as it approached the river
								</kw></li></ul>
							</li></ul>
							</li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">Order of battle:
							</kw><ul>
								<li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">Persians
								</kw><ul>
									<li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">deployed infantry behind a screen of light infantry and cavalry
									</kw><ul>
										<li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">ca. 20,000 Greek mercenary hoplites in the center of the line
										</kw></li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">lighter infantry on the wings, screened by archers
										</kw></li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">Asiaitic troops in the rear
										</kw></li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">Strong force of light-armed troops on the left, along the foothills, in advance of his line
										</kw></li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">banks of the river reenfoced at its more accesible points with stockades
									</kw></li></ul>
								</li></ul>
								</li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">Alexander
								</kw><ul>
									<li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">Parmenio with Thessalian cavalry on the left, with archers and javelin-men behind them
									</kw></li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">Phalanx brigades in center with the Hypaspists on the center right
									</kw></li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">Companion cavalry on the right, with support of light-armed troops
									</kw></li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">sent a detachment of light-armed troops to counter the threat of the Persian light-armed troops in the foothills, but the Persians withdrew at the Macedonian approach, so this squadron was able to strengthen Alexander's right during the battle
								</kw></li></ul>
							</li></ul>
							</li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">Tactical plans:
							</kw><ul>
								<li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">Darius probably planning to flank Alexander with his cavalry, particularly on his right, where the cavalry can use the level ground along the coastline; then wheel around to smash the Macedonian infantry in the rear
								</kw></li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">Alexander planning to use the cavalry to break the Persian line, giving his infantry an opening
								</kw></li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">Plans (typical of the Persians and Macedonians) were thus in a sense complimentary
							</kw></li></ul>
							</li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">Battle
							</kw><ul>
								<li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">Alexander moved his troops steadily forward
								</kw></li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">when they came within range of the Persian bows, he ordered a charge
								</kw><ul>
									<li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">infantry advanced on the double
									</kw></li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">Alexander led the Companion cavalry into the river, up the far bank, through the archers, and into the infantry on the Persian left center
									</kw><ul>
										<li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">Two rightmost battalions of the Macedonian phalanx follow Alexander, but the ramaining four battalions couldn't force their way up the banks, leaving a gap in the Macedonian line
										</kw></li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">Darius' mercenaries rushed into the gap, struggle ensued in which 120 Macedonians fell
										</kw><ul>
											<li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">once the two battalions on the left had finished with the Persian right, they wheeled back to deal with the mercenaries and relieve the Macedonian center
										</kw></li></ul>
									</li></ul>
									</li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">On the Macedonian left, Pesian cavalry had crossed the river and forced the Thessalians back
									</kw><ul>
										<li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">diffiuclt struggle: Thessalians were outnumbered, and the Persian cavalry was more heavily armoured
										</kw></li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">but they held their positions to prevent the Persians from outflanking the line on the left
									</kw></li></ul>
									</li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">As Alexander and the Companions break through the Persian line, Darius takes flight, first on chariot, and then, jettisoning his weapons, on horseback
									</kw><ul>
										<li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">flight of the king and the breakup of the Persian center caused the Persian right to break off its engagement with the Thessalian cavalry
										</kw></li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">Alexander doesn't pursue until he's relieved his own center
									</kw></li></ul>
								</li></ul>
								</li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">General rout ensued
								</kw><ul>
									<li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">Persians retreating along narrow, crowded routes are easy targets for Alexander's army
									</kw></li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">Alexander pursued Darius until darkness fell, but he gets away, although his arms are captured, as are his wife, mother, and infant son in the Persian camp
									</kw><ul>
										<li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">Darius with about 4,000 surivors manages to escape into Babylon
										</kw></li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">most of the Greek mercenaries escaped, but not with Darius
									</kw></li></ul>
									</li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">Macedonians lost about 450 men, with 10 times as many wounded
									</kw></li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">Persian losses difficult to assess
									</kw></li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">Parmenio soon afterwards takes possesion of the Persian baggage depot in Damscus
									</kw><ul>
										<li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">this, along with the Persian camp at Issus, provides Alexander with tremendous booty

						<p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">The Siege of Tyre</kw></p>
						<ul>
							<li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">After Issus, Alexander refused the temptation to pursue Darius east, and stayed focused on his goal of securing the Mediterranean coast
							</kw></li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">Headed south, and the great Phonecian cities of Byblos and Sidon surrendered
							</kw></li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">At Tyre, however, he met resistance
							</kw><ul>
								<li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">Highly fortified island city
								</kw><ul>

								</li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">Late in the morning, Alexander gave the order to advance

									</kw></li></ul>
									</li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">Darius sent his cavlary units on the left to advance against Alexander's right

									</li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">Desperate situation for Alexander's army
									</kw><ul>
										<li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">but the Persians who had broken the Macedonian line kept moving forward to try to loot the Macedonian camp, rather than wheeling around to hammer the Macedonians in the rear

									</li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">Darius pressed on Alexander's right
									</kw><ul>
										<li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">in doing so, several Persian cavalry units moved ahead and left a gap between the Persian left cavalry and infantry

									</kw></li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">Parmenio still hard-pressed on the left: this time word of the king's flight apparently hadn't reached the entire line. So Alexander has to relieve his left rather than pursue Darius
									</kw><ul>
										<li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">The Persian center, however, did flee with the king, and Alexander had to force his way through the crowds of Persian infantry, many of whom kept their formation in retreat
									</kw></li></ul>
									</li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">By the time Alexander breaks through to relieve Parmenio, he had managed to force the Persian cavalry back, and the entire Persian force was routed

								</kw></li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">possibility of a head-on assault by Alexander made difficult by the presence of the elephants, which frightened the horses too much for them to be carried across on rafts,
							</kw></li></ul>
							</li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">Instead, Alexander adopted a ruse:
							</kw><ul>
								<li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">for several nights running, he marched his cavalry up and down the banks of the river, making lots of noise, to force Porus to move his elephants to match
								</kw></li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">eventually, Porus got tired of the chasing, and stayed in his camp
							</kw></li></ul>
							</li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">At that point, Alexander left his general Craterus at the original base with 5,000 troops and some cavalry, and himself moved (during the night and in the midst of a heavy rainstorm) 18 miles north.

							</kw></li></ul>

								<li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">Porus meanwhile had learned that Alexander was trying to cross the river, and sent a squadron of 2,000 cavalry with 120 chariots to defend the banks
								</kw></li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">They were too late, and as they came into view Alexander charged them in squadrons, eventually exhausting them and putting them to flight, capturing the chariots in the process
							</kw></li></ul>
							</li><li><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">Porus decided to move his forces against Alexander, though he left a small guard with some elephants to prevent Craterus from crossing. Chose a battle site that was relatively unmuddy from the recent rain</kw><br>
