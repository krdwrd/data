<p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-2">
 
1. Freedom from internal control: 5.0
</kw></p><p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
There was a time in South Africa's history where Colored individuals in 
South Africa had to keep personal ID and passport to move around the city, 
segregation of the races were practice and often forcefully enforced. This 
era is too commonly known as the apartheid.However things has changed, every 
citizen in South Africa nowadays have personal liberties, and rights, no 
longer are they forced to keep passports to move around the country, they 
are free from government oppression.

2. Freedom of speech: 3.0
</kw></p><p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
Unlike the US bill of rights, South Africa does not have a formal 
legislation banning or protecting free speech, however the South African 
government has been very lenient on this subject, occasionally when marches 
or public rallies occur, and people do say something degrading or hurtful 
toward the government or the president, police will arrest them. However the 
press and for most of the times individuals can say what they want.

3. Effective Police Force: 0.5
</kw></p><p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
South Africa's police force is ineffective, Although crime is going down 
statistically, the police force needs better training. As enforcers of the 
law many officers believe they hold a higher status among the population, 
they often ask for free goods from merchants, they believe they deserve such 
treatment because they are keeping south Africa safe, but this is far from 
so, A police station was 2 blocks away, when several men robbed a store, the 
police was called in, it took half an hour for police to arrive, the 
criminals Escaped.

</kw></p><p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-2">
4. Private Property: 3.0
</kw></p><p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
Creating a house or business is relatively easy, very little legal work is 
required, Once completed one can go ahead and create a house or business. 
Even though this is easy there is still the factor of people living in 
shacks, this is very common in South Africa, large squatter camps strewn 
along highways and main roads, an image of United states during the Great 
depression is easily created. There is however initiatives to get them off 
the streets, cheap housing are being built through out the country and 
hopefully this will help decrease the great number of homelessness.

5. Commercial Banks: 3.0
</kw></p><p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
Solely banks in South Africa collect and loan out money to its customers. 
Recently, many of the bigger banks are operating very well. However, things 
wasn?t always that way, 5 major banks went bankrupt during the 1990?s 
showing that no matter how big a bank is and how well it is doing they can 
fall prey to bankruptcy and internal problems. Even when these big banks 
fell, crisis was avoided as larger banks merged or took over the bankrupt 
banks, taking over their debts and their customers.

6. Communication: 4.0
</kw></p><p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
With rapid advancement in technology, communication has rapidly improved in 
South Africa. In many instances smaller villages, which still are common in 
South Africa, were left out of society, as they had very little or no way of 
communicating with the bigger suburbs. However this has changed, Telkom, 
South Africa?s Single and largest telecommunication provider has reached out 
and provided these small villages a way for them to interact with society. 
Over 5.5 million telephones have been installed through out South Africa and 
daily the number is growing. Other forms of communication is slowly 
following the guidance of telephones, The internet is slowly finding its way 
into businesses and homes, although it is expensive and sometimes lacking in 
speed, time will change this. TV, most households in South Africa has a TV 
set. Although only 5 channels are readily available to the TV owner, a 
Satellite can be installed to receive a broader number of channels. Every 
province(state) in South Africa has its own newspaper, the star for example 
is for Gauteng, it is available at large quantities for the public, almost 
every crossroad is guarded by a newspaper seller, ready to sell newspapers 
to inform South Africa citizens on the latest news.

7. Transportion: 4.5
</kw></p><p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
Transportation and traveling into and out of South Africa is improving 
everyday, Railroads totaling to 20,384 km links South Africa?s 9 provinces 
and 6 countries including Botswana, Lesotho, Mozambique, Namibia, Swaziland 
and Zimbabwe. Traveling within South Africa is also good. Highways totalling 
358,596 km, provide automobiles convenient and faster routes for travelling 
citizens.

8. Education: 4.5
</kw></p><p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
Education in South Africa is totally different from education in the United 
States, unlike the U.S., Education is paid for by a students parent, not 
through taxes but a direct check or cash deposit into the high school or 
primary(middle) school that their son or daughter is attending. Noble peace 
prize winner and former president Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela, expressed his 
concern of education in S.A., in 1993 in a national speech he said, ?study 
revealed that although in 1976, 84.8% of students passed(graduated) 
matric(senior year), with 25.2% achieving distinctions(achieving A?s in all 
subjects), in 1990 those figures had crashed to 36.4% and 7.45% 
respectively.? With figures that show such numbers anyone would be concern 
however, the youth has stepped up from the past, In 2004 the highest number 
of matrics graduating was recorded with 92.2% passing. Education is 
improving in South Africa, the question is can it stay that way in the long 
run.

9. Social mobility: 5.0
</kw></p><p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
During the Apartheid, Caucasians had overall control in skillful jobs, they 
had better education and better influence. Nowadays Educated Blacks, Indians 
and Asians are slowly coming in and sharing the good jobs with the white 
population, a great number of students get education from overseas, getting 
a better education so that they can get a better job once they come back to 
South Africa and search for a job in the job market.

10. Freedom from outside control: 2.0
</kw></p><p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
Although South Africa won its independence from Britain in 1910, Many 
countries still have influence in doing ?what they want to? in South Africa. 
5 former Symbionese Liberation Army members who were notorious in the 
1970?s, operating around California, robbing banks and attempting to blow up 
LAPD police cars, were arrested in October 2001, living in South Africa 
under alias names. FBI investigators arrested these fugitives and they were 
kept in a South African prison, only later did the U.S. request that these 
individuals be extradited to stand trial in U.S. soil.

11. Foreign Currency Transactions: 2.5
</kw></p><p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
In South Africa the recognized currency is the Rand. However in many 
instances smaller businesses that do encounter customers who wield Dollars 
and Euros are willing to sell their products for these strong currencies. 
However bigger corporations will only accept the S.A Rand.

12. Border Control 1.0
</kw></p><p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
South Africa shares it border with 4 other countries, namely Namibia, 
Zimbabwe, Botswana and Mozambique, while 2 countries Swaziland and Lesotho 
are situated within South Africas borders. Because of this and a lack border 
agents, illegal immigration is very high, to get into South Africa is merely 
climbing over a fence.

13. Currency 5.0
</kw></p><p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
The sole currency of S.A is the South African Rand(R). Its worth compared to 
the US$ stands at R1 = US$ 0.15 meaning a US$ can be changed into R6.64, 
this shows that the Rand is weak against to the US$, it is weak against the 
Euro and other major currencies.

14. Culture, language homogeneity 3.0
</kw></p><p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
South Africa represents a vast array of ethnic backgrounds. Officially there 
are 11 languages; Afrikaans, English, Zulu and a host of African languages 
form these 11. however communcation is not a major problem, most of the 
citizens of South Africa are english literate, and therefore are able to 
communicate with each other.

15. Political effectiveness 3.0
</kw></p><p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
There has been no real big disaster that has occured on the soils of South 
Africa so far. Forest fires are common in the summer in South Africa, but 
due to being prepared, many forest fires are ended before they grow out of 
control, the political system of south africa is not very strong however, 
with a large number for debt, if a disaster does occur, government may not 
have the resources or the money to fix what the disaster has destroyed.

16. Institutional Stability 4.5
</kw></p><p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
When the Apartheid ended in the late 1990's so did the racist and corrupt 
government of old. A new government was set up by Mr. Nelson Mandela, As 
president he set up a government where whites, blacks and Other minority 
groups joined to improve South Africa. Organizations began to spring up to 
improve certain aspects such as sports and recreation. All the goals of 
these organizations were to rebuild and fix what the apartheid had 
destroyed. These goals still stay true to these organizations, the 
government is stable and has not changed a lot, they still set to improve 
South Africa.

17. Honest Government 2.0
</kw></p><p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
In modern society an honest government comes far and few. In South Africa 
the government is constantly in the news about corruption, only recently the 
Vice-president was the headline as he had pocketed a huge amount of cash, 
while others wondered where the money went, he was caught and he stepped 
down from his position but if he could do it, the next vice president can do 
it too. Under Transparency International, South Africa was rated a 4.5 
score, 0 being corrupt and 10 being not. With a 4.5 score it shows S.A. is 
on the lower end.

18. Common Law 1.0
</kw></p><p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
Not everyone is treated equally under the law in South Africa, Unlike the 
U.S. there is no fifth amendment in the South African law. That leads to the 
reason why not everyone is treated equally under the law, the poor are often 
viewed as the trouble makers and because of that they don?t deserve the same 
rights as other individuals. 'The poor are the one who are the problem 
makers' stated a government official.

19. Central Banking 2.0
</kw></p><p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
The South African reserve bank is the central bank of South Africa, it 
regard its primary goal as 'the achievement and maintenance of financial 
stability' the government has very close ties with the reserve bank, 
Government appoints its directors, but however it is politically independent 
and runs independently to carry out its job.

21. Government debt 2.0
</kw></p><p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
Statistically, South Africa ranks as a ?good? income country; it was rated 
as being 64 out of 208 tracked countries. South Africa?s governmental debt 
is comparable to many other developing countries, currently the figure is 
$25 billion, most of it accrued since the apartheid era. $12 billion is 
interest! However government is trying to end its debt by quickly repaying 
the debt. 45.9% is the percentage payments with regard to GDP.

23. Protection of public health and safety 3.0
</kw></p><p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
South Africa?s government, nongovernmental organizations and research 
institutions have undertaken major initiatives over the past decade to raise 
the country?s awareness of public health., In urban areas medical facilities 
are easily found, but within smaller ?poor? vicinities there are less and 
poorly maintained medical institutions. Pharmacies are well stocked and 
comparable t those in the United States. Mortality rates stand at 45 deaths 
per 1000 births an improvement from 62 from 1000. However the biggest 
concern is AIDS/HIV. An estimated 40 million people or 21.5% of the 
population is HIV positive or has AIDS. Of all the people living with 
AIDS/HIV 13% can be found in South Africa! An estimated 600 people die daily 
due to HIV related illnesses. Slowly health care is improving but is it too 
late?

24. High wage policy 3.0
</kw></p><p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
In South Africa unemployment is extremely high and rising. It is seen as one 
of the most socio-political problems facing the government. Half of the 
population sits below the poverty line, while the other half is pretty well 
off. Most of the working population are able to afford homes and cars, but 
that doesn't mean workers are satisfied, occasionally marches and 
'toi-toi's' (demonstrations) occur where labor unions demand better pay.

25 Environmental Policy 5.0
</kw></p><p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
Government branches such as the Department of water affairs and forestry 
have devised plans which will ensure the protection of South Africa?s 
environment. Due to excessive mining and human activities over the years the 
number of indigenous animals and plants are dwindling. As a way to preserve 
South Africa?s environment, stricter laws are enforced, poaching and 
destruction of forestry by any individual is punishable by fines or prison, 
this was the main objective of The Consultative National Environmental 
Policy Process (CONNEPP), which was put forth in 1995.

26. Strong army 1.0
</kw></p><p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
South Africa's "antique" army isn't something to be proud of, there is 
currently +- 75,000 active soldiers in South Africa's army. Many of the 
soldiers are aged between 32-36 and many believe they are too old; there is 
even a figure that shows that 60% of South Africans Army is HIV positive. 
Included in South Africa?s arsenal are 168 tanks of which 4 are operational, 
and 8 of 242 armored cars are battle worthy. South Africa?s air force 
consist of several fearsome Russian super fighter MIG?s but the bite of 
these planes are long gone as they are incompetent in facing modern day jet 
fighters. A positive is the attack helicopter Rooivark, a South African 
Manufactured Helicopter, $200 million has been set aside to build more of 
these helicopters, of which half will be sold to foreign countries.

GDP/Exports and Imports = 46%
</kw></p><p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
46% of GDP is made up of foreign trade (Export and Import). This is a large 
percentage of GDP, as a 30% is a more appropriate number for any country, 
therefore the country is relying heavily on foreign trade to grow and 
flourish, without trade South Africa would certainly struggle economically.

28. Protection of foreign currency earning enterprise 4.0
</kw></p><p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
The Foreign Investment Act set up by the governments of Namibia and South 
Africa was to lure lucrative foreign investors into their countries, many 
foreign investors have seized such opportunities and many companies are 
funded and run by overseas businesses. As a way to lure those (foreign 
investors) in, the government of South Africa has not created special laws 
that would chase off the investors, foreign owned businesses are taxed 
equally and income earned by the companies overseas will not be taxed. 
Meaning all businesses are taxed based on the same standards.

30. Layers of Collective Action: 4.0
Unlike the United States, South Africa does not have three different 
branches of government, a single, strong and fair government is run by the 
President. Under him is the vice-president and then his several advisors. 
South Africa is split into 9 provinces (states), each state is governed by 
their respective provincial government, led by a mayor. Other local leaders 
are responsible for their neighbourhoods. All these leaders from mayor to 
president is elected by the people of South Africa through provincial 
elections which takes place every 4 years.

31. Pro business climate: 2.0
</kw></p><p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
After the Apartheid era South Africa?s economy flourished under the guidance 
of private businesses. Nowadays, people with moderate paying jobs are able 
to buy luxurious homes, and most of the adult population are able to send 
their children to schools and universities. However poverty is still a major 
problem, and a large percentage of the population live in little shacks, 
these little shacks litter poverty stricken areas and are famously known as 
squatter camps.

32. Government enterprises: 1.0
</kw></p><p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
As mentioned before the South African government has very little involvement 
in South Africa?s business enterprises. After the Apartheid all of the 
governments enterprises converted into private ones. Basically South 
Africa?s government takes a back seat when it comes to owning businesses. 
However the government does try and lure Foreign Investors onto the African 
shore giving South African Businesses a helping hand.

South Africa joined the Southern African Development Community (SADC) in 
August 1994. This twelve member organization, which includes, Angola, 
Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, Swaziland, 
Tanzania, Zambia, and Zimbabwe promotes economic development and security 
affairs between these countries. Many Militias and Warlords still operate in 
Angola and Zimbabwe, and because of that the SADC has regularly assembled to 
try and end such Hazards, peacekeeping forces from South Africa and Namibia 
can be seen operating in these countries.

34. Protection of domestic enterprises from government mandatory cost: 4.0
</kw></p><p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
Unlike communist countries, South Africa has a "free" market policy, a
policy where the government has very little influence in business 
enterprises. There is however government branches such as the South African 
Revenue Service (SARS) that set and enforce tax and customs legislation on 
businesses. Annually, SARS collects an excess of US$30 billion. Another 
mandatory cost that is payable by a business towards a government branch is 
UIF (Unemployment Insurance Fund).
