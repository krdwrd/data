        <br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
        The French Territory of the Afars and the Issas became Djibouti in 1977. 
        In November 1991, the mainly Afar-supported Front for the Restoration 
        of Unity and Democracy (FRUD) began fighting the Issa-dominated government. 
        Sporadic attacks continued in 1997 and 2000. On May 12, 2001, President 
        Ismail Omar Guelleh presided over the signing of the final peace accord 
        officially ending the decade-long civil war. France maintains one of its 
        largest military bases outside France in Djibouti with some 2,800 troops 
        as well as warships, aircraft and armored vehicles. In addition to French 
        troops, Djibouti has become a launching point for the US war on terrorism 
        in the Middle East. United States troops have been stationed and passing 
        through the country since late-2002. In exchange for use of territory, 
        the United States has offered monetary assistance to help Djibouti improve 
        its counterterrorism operations.</kw></p>
      <p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">Djibouti's main economic asset is its strategic location. The city of 
        Djibouti, capital and home to nearly two-thirds of the country's population, 
        is a major transshipment port and bunkering facility. Good transportation 
        infrastructure with the country and links to neighboring African states 
        earns Djibouti much-needed transit taxes and harbor fees. Trade through 
        Djibouti increased significantly during the Ethiopian-Eritrean war when 
        Djibouti became the only significant port for landlocked Ethiopia.</kw></p>
      <p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">Djibouti is working to significantly expand the capacity of its ports 
        by building a new oil jetty to accommodate oil products, LPG, edible oils, 
        and bitumen on vessels up to 120,000 deadweight tons (DWT) and have the 
        capacity to handle 100,000 cubic meters of petroleum products. This first 
        phase of port expansion will begin in September 2003, with operations 
        beginning a year later. The second phase of the project adds a $300 million, 
        2,000 meter long, mega container port. The new additions to Djibouti's 
        ports, supported by Emirates National Oil and Dubai Ports International, 
        will enable the port of Djibouti to meet growing cargo requirements over 
        the next 20 years.</kw></p>
      <p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">Djibouti's real gross domestic product (GDP) is expected to grow 2.8% 
        in 2003, following estimated growth of 2.4% in 2002, and 1.9% in 2001. 
        Strong growth has been fueled by the transportation and communication 
        sectors as well as the trade and tourism sectors, which together make 
        up more than 40% of GDP. An unemployment rate of 40% to 50% continues 
        to be a major problem for Djibouti's economy. In December 2002, the International 
        Monetary Fund (IMF) approved the third disbursement of funds ($6 million) 
        from a Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) signed with Djibouti 
        in 1999.</kw></p>
      <p><b><kw class="krdwrd-tag-2">OIL</kw></b><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
        Although there is currently no upstream (exploration or production) oil 
        activity in Djibouti, the government has tried to generate interest in 
        offshore oil exploration without success. The downstream oil sector, however, 
        is an important aspect of Djibouti's economy, given the role the capital 
        city plays as a significant regional bunkering and refueling facility. 
        Three companies--ExxonMobil, Shell and Total-- handle refueling at Djibouti's 
        port. The companies, along with ChevronTexaco, also distribute and market 
        petroleum products in the country. Storage capacity at the port facility 
        is 1.26 million barrels (200,000 cubic meters). The Dubai Ports Authority 
        (DPA) was awarded a 20-year contract in June 2000 to manage the port. 
        DPA hopes to increase Djibouti's handling capacity from 125,000 metric 
        tons to 300,000 metric tons per year and to make it the leading transshipment 
        point on the African continent.</kw></p>
      <p><b><kw class="krdwrd-tag-2">ELECTRICITY</kw></b><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
        Djibouti currently has installed electricity generating capacity of 85 
        megawatts (MW), all of which is thermal (oil-fired). In January 2001, 
        U.S.-based Geothermal Development Associates (GDA) announced that it had 
        completed a feasibility study on the development of a 30-MW geothermal 
        power plant in Djibouti. The study, which commenced in August 2000, established 
        the commercial viability of the proposed generating facility. The $115 
        million plant, to be located in the Lake Assal region west of the capital, 
        will be constructed on the build own operate (BOO) financing scheme. The 
        Global Environmental Facility (GEF), a joint initiative of the World Bank 
        and the United Nations (UN), has approved a $280,000 financing package 
        to pay for contract negotiations required for the project. To date, however, 
        these funds have not been released. At the same time, however, Electricite 
        de Djibouti, the national electric company, has begin to remove aging 
        diesel-fired generating units. To continue to provide power to rural residents, 
        the government, with the help of a grant from a number of Arab financial 
        institutions, is installing solar and wind capacity. The primary goal 
        of the project is to replace old diesel powered rural water pumps with 
        new ones powered by renewable resources, but excess energy will be used 
        for electrification.</kw></p>

        In 1952, a UN resolution federating the former Italian colony of Eritrea 
        with Ethiopia went into effect. In 1962, Emperor Haile Selassie unilaterally 
        dissolved the Eritrean parliament and annexed the country. The Eritrean 
        fight for independence continued even after Haile Selassie was ousted 
        in a coup in 1974. A 30-year struggle for independence ended in 1991, 
        with Eritrean rebels defeating the governmental forces led by Mengistu 
        Haile Miriam. On April 23-25, 1993, Eritreans voted overwhelmingly for 
        independence from Ethiopia in a UN-monitored free and fair referendum. 
        The Eritrean authorities declared Eritrea an independent state on April 
        27, 1993. The National Assembly was elected in national, freely contested 
        election and then chose former liberation movement leader Isaias Afwerki 
        as President.</kw></p>
      <p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">When Eritrea and Ethiopia separated amicably in 1993, several border 
        issues remained unresolved. Fighting broke out between the two countries 
        in May 1998 and continued until June 2000 when both sides accepted an 
        Organization of African Unity (OAU) peace proposal. The formal treaty 
        ending the war was signed on December 12, 2000 and an independent entity, 
        the Eritrea Ethiopia Boundary Commission (EEBC) was established to determine 
        the new border. The EEBC released its report on April 13, 2002, but Ethiopia 
        is contesting some of the commission's decisions. </kw></p>
      <p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">Growth of the Eritrean economy was hampered by the war. Eritrea's real 
        GDP growth in the two years prior to the conflict averaged 7.4%. Real 
        GDP growth fell to 4.0% in 1998, 0.8% in 1999 and -8.2% in 2000. With 
        the cessation of hostilities, real GDP growth of 9.7% was observed in 
        2001, and growth of 8.8% in 2002. Continued growth of 7.1% is expected 
        in 2003. Inflation is an ongoing problem, it was 24% in 2002, but it is 
        expected to decline to less than 15% in 2003. Multilateral and bilateral 
        donors have pledged nearly $132 million towards the demobilization of 
        200,000 Eritrean soldiers and the social and economic recovery of the 
        country. Donor development funding is seen as crucial in the improvement 
        of the country's economy.</kw></p>
      <p><b><kw class="krdwrd-tag-2">OIL</kw></b><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
        Hydrocarbon exploration, primarily offshore in the Red Sea, began in the 
        1960's when Eritrea was still federated with Ethiopia. In 1995, Eritrea 
        signed a production sharing contract (PSC) with U.S.-based Anadarko Petroleum 
        (Anadarko) for the offshore Zula Block. Anadarko signed a second PSC for 
        the offshore Edd Block, located south of the Zula Block, in September 
        1997. Anadarko announced, in December 1997, that it had reached an agreement 
        with ENI/Agip (Agip) to swap interests in exploration acreage. Anadarko 
        received a 25% interest in a Tunisian block operated by Agip, and Agip 
        received a 30% share in the 6.7-million acre Zula Block and 30% interest 
        in the Edd Block. Burlington Resources, a U.S.-based independent, later 
        joined the consortium by acquiring a 20% interest in both acreages. Anadarko's 
        first two exploration wells, both drilled on the Zula Block, were unsuccessful. 
        In January 1999, a third dry well, Edd-1 on the Edd Block, was drilled. 
        Citing the disappointing exploration results, Anadarko and its partners 
        ceased exploration activities and relinquished their rights to the offshore 
        blocks.</kw></p>
      <p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">A more recent attempt also did not meet with success. In May 2001, U.S.-firm 
        CMS Energy signed an exploration agreement for a 14,000-square kilometer 
        block in northeastern Eritrea but the company has released its claim as 
        it put its entire oil exploration and production unit up for sale in May 
        2002.</kw></p>

        narrow waterway situated between Eritrea, Djibouti and Yemen that connects 
        the Red Sea with the Gulf of Aden and the Arabian Sea. In 2000, it was 
        estimated that around 3.2-3.3 million barrels per day (bbl/d) of oil flowed 
        through the Bab el-Mandeb. Disruptions or closure of the Bab el-Mandeb 
        could keep tankers from the Persian Gulf from reaching the </kw><a href="http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/cabs/choke.html#SUEZ"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">Suez Canal/Sumed Pipeline</kw></a><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">

        Good Hope). This would add greatly to transit time and cost, and effectively 
        tie up spare tanker capacity. The Bab el-Mandeb could be bypassed (for 
        northbound oil traffic) by utilizing the East-West oil pipeline, which 
        traverses </kw><a href="http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/cabs/saudi.html"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">Saudi 
        Arabia</kw></a><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3"> and has a capacity of about 4.8 million bbl/d. However, southbound 
        oil traffic would still be blocked. In addition, closure of the Bab el-Mandeb 
        would effectively block non-oil shipping from using the Suez Canal, except 
        for limited trade within the Red Sea region.</kw></p>
      <p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">In December 1995 and again in August 1996, Eritrean and Yemeni forces 
        clashed over control of the Hanish Islands, located just north of the 
        Bab el-Mandeb. In October 1996, the two countries signed an agreement 
        over the islands. The two sides agreed to put their case before an international 
        court of arbitration (</kw><a href="http://www.pca-cpa.org/"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">Permanent Court 
        of Arbitration</kw></a><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">-PCA). The court will then issue two rulings; one on 
        who has sovereignty over the disputed area, and one on the demarcation 
        of the two sides' maritime boundary. In October 1998, the PCA ruled that 
        the Hanish Islands are subject to the territorial sovereignty of Yemen.

        Eritrea has crude refining capacity of 18,000 bbl/d, but the refinery 
        located in the Red Sea port of Assab has been shut down since 1997 due 
        to the high operating and maintenance costs. Ethiopia and Eritrea, joint 
        operators of the facility, decided to close the Assab refinery in August 
        1997 and import refined petroleum products to meet domestic needs.</kw></p>
      <p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">Eritrea's petroleum consumption was estimated at 6,000 bbl/d in 2001. 
        Marketing and distribution of petroleum products is performed by ExxonMobil, 
        Shell and Total. In June 2000, Shell purchased the downstream operations 
        of Agip in several African countries including Eritrea and Ethiopia. The 
        Eritrean assets included service stations, two petroleum product depots 
        and an LPG (liquefied petroleum gas) filling station.</kw></p>
      <p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">In August 2000, Sudan's National Petroleum Company announced plans to 
        lay pipelines to supply Eritrea and Ethiopia with petroleum products from 
        its Khartoum refinery. Eritrea has not yet benefited from Sudanese oil 
        and relations between the two countries soured in April 2003 when Sudan 
        accused Eritrea of supporting Sudanese rebels in the eastern part of Sudan. 
        Although Eritrea denies the charges, future trade relationships are unlikely 
        under the current climate.</kw></p>
      <p><b><kw class="krdwrd-tag-2">ELECTRICITY</kw></b><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
        Eritrea has approximately 60 MW of diesel-fired generating capacity. The 
        Eritrean Electricity Authority (EEA) handles generation, transmission 
        and distribution of electricity. In 1997, South Korean firms Daewoo and 
        Hanjung signed an agreement to build a heavy oil-fired plant in at Hirgigo, 
        just outside of Massawa. The plant, nearly completed, was damaged in a 
        bombing raid by Ethiopia in 2000. In 2001, Eritrea signed loan agreements 
        with the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia for the facility's repair. 
        The 88 MW facility came online in March 2003, but many industry experts 
        fear that the new capacity could overload Eritrea's dated grid system. 
        Both the European Development Fund and the World Bank have considered

        about 80% of the Eritrean population without access to electricity. Some 
        smaller villages have community diesel generators which can provide small 
        amounts of electricity to households. Photovoltaic (PV) electricity generation 
        is being used in special applications throughout the country. Twenty-six 
        rural health centers are each supplied with 2-kilowatt (kW) solar photovoltaic 
        power systems for refrigeration, lighting, operating theaters, fans, and 
        laboratory equipment. Additionally, the majority of the 140 rural clinics 
        are equipped with solar powered vaccine refrigerators. Approximately 3% 
        (about 60 villages) of Eritrea's villages have been supplied with PV systems 
        (0.8 to 1.2kW) to power water pumps to supply drinking water. Each system 
        serves a minimum of 300 households. Over 70 rural schools (out of 700)

        is the oldest independent country in Africa. Unique among African countries, 
        Ethiopia maintained its freedom from colonial rule, except during the 
        Italian occupation of 1936-41. In 1974, a military junta, the Derg, deposed 
        Emperor Haile Selassie, who had ruled since 1930, and established a socialist 
        state. The Derg was toppled by a coalition of rebel forces, the Ethiopian 
        People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF), in 1991. A constitution 
        was adopted in 1994 and Ethiopia's first multiparty elections were held 
        in 1995. A two-year border war with Eritrea ended when a peace treaty 
        was signed in December 2000. Disagreement on the location of the border 
        between the two countries is ongoing, despite the final ruling of a commission 
        charged with identifying the border.</kw></p>
      <p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">Ethiopia's economy is primarily agrarian, with the agricultural sector 
        accounting for 45% of GDP and 80% of the workforce. Coffee, Ethiopia's 
        primary export crop, accounted for 58% of total exports in 1999, and has 
        averaged two-thirds of all export earnings over the last 20 years. Other 
        important agricultural exports include qat (khat), a mild stimulant from 
        the leaves of the Catha Edulis shrub, pulses, oilseeds, live animals and 
        hides. Ethiopia's real GDP growth was 5.4% in 2000 and increased to 7.7% 
        in 2001. Growth in 2002 slowed to 4.3% as a severe drought decimated agricultural 
        production. Growth forecasts for 2003 suggest that the economy will expand 
        by 4.0% </kw></p>
      <p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">Although continued donor support is seen as the crucial element in Ethiopia's 
        economic reform, both the IMF and World Bank suspended new lending to 
        Ethiopia during the border war with Eritrea. The suspension was lifted 
        after the signing of the peace accord in December 2000. The World Bank 
        approved a $400 million loan to finance emergency recovery, military demobilization 
        and reintegration projects. In July 2001, the IMF approved a $112 million 
        PGRF to support Ethiopia's economic program. In November 2001, the IMF 
        and World Bank announced that Ethiopia was eligible for a $1.9 billion 
        debt relief package under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative, 
        becoming the 24th country to qualify for debt relief under the HIPC's 
        enhanced framework. The savings in debt service resulting from the HIPC 
        are substantial, amounting to about $96 million per year on average until 
        2021. The resources made available by debt relief provided under the HIPC 
        will be allocated to key anti-poverty programs. Poverty-targeted expenditures 
        are projected to increase steadily, from 10.9% of GDP in 2001, to 14.7% 
        in 2002, and 15.5% in 2003.</kw></p>
      <p><b><kw class="krdwrd-tag-2">OIL AND NATURAL GAS</kw></b><br><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
        Ethiopia's current proven hydrocarbon reserves are minimal, but the potential 
        to increase reserves to commercial viability is seen as promising. The 
        country's geology is similar to that of its oil-producing neighbors to 
        the east (on the Arabian peninsula) and the west (Sudan). In April 2001, 
        the Ministry of Mines and Energy reported that hydrocarbon seeps had been 
        discovered in several regions. The government plans to conduct feasibility 
        studies to establish the extent and viability of the deposits.</kw></p>
      <p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">Hydrocarbon exploration in Ethiopia's Ogaden Basin began over 80 years 
        ago (Standard Oil in 1920). The Ethiopian government formed the Calub 
        Gas Share Company (CGSC) to develop the fields. In 1994, the World Bank 
        approved a $74 million loan to develop the Ogaden Basin fields. The Ethiopian 
        Privatization Agency (EPA) put the CGSC up for privatization in 1998, 
        but the EPA, citing weak bids, withdrew the tender. In December 1999, 
        Houston-based Sicor announced that it had signed a $1.4 billion joint-venture 
        deal to develop the Calub natural gas project. Under the terms of the 
        agreement, Gasoil Ethiopia Project (GEP), the joint-venture firm, will 
        acquire 95% of the CGSC under the Ethiopian government's privatization 
        law. Currently, 5% of the CGSC is held by local private investors. The 
        Ethiopian government will hold a 20% interest in GEP with Sicor holding 
        the remaining share. GEP plans to construct a 375-mile, 24-inch pipeline 
        to transmit natural gas to the town of Awash, which is approximately 75 
        miles east of the capital Addis Ababa. At Awash, plans call for construction 
        of a cryogenic liquids plant and two gas-to-liquids process systems with 
        capacity to process 200 million cubic feet per day (Mmcf/d) of natural 
        gas. The end products will be synthetic fuels and petrochemical feedstocks 
        plus steam that will generate electricity and help produce 20,000 bbl/d 
        of potable water. A planned refinery will produce products including diesel, 
        gasoline, kerosene and jet fuels. The gas-to-liquids system will also 
        produce some 500 tons of ammonia per day as feedstock for a urea plant 
        to be constructed. Although construction on the pipeline was scheduled 
        to begin in the summer of 2002, gas development in Ogaden has not yet 
        begun.</kw></p>
      <p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">In June 2003, the Ethiopian government signed an oil exploration deal

        part of the country. The region is closely related the Sudan oil fields. 
        Petronas has committed to investing in regional infrastructure, employing 
        local staff, improving health services, and developing the skills of the 
        ministry of Mines. Petronas is also interested in natural gas exploration 
        in Ogaden, but no official plans have yet been made.</kw></p>

        Ethiopia's petroleum consumption was estimated at 23,000 bbl/d in 2001. 
        With the closure of the Assab refinery in 1997, Ethiopia is totally reliant 
        on imports to meet its petroleum requirements. Some petroleum imports 
        are received at the port of Djibouti, and shipped via rail and tanker 
        truck to Ethiopia. With the recent development of oil in Sudan, however, 
        Ethiopia has begun importing oil which, under COMESA, is not subject to 
        tariffs. Oil imports from Sudan began in January 2003 transported by tanker 
        trucks along a new road between the two countries. Since the trade began, 
        however, oil shipments, which are expected to meet 85% of Ethiopia's gasoline 
        requirements, have halted twice. Nevertheless, the two countries have 
        agreed to upgrade the road along this important transit corridor to increase 
        commerce.</kw></p>
      <p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">Marketing and distribution of petroleum products is performed by ExxonMobil, 
        Shell and Total. In June 2000, Shell purchased the downstream operations

        Ethiopia has approximately 529 MW of installed generating capacity. The 
        vast majority of Ethiopia's existing capacity (85%) is hydroelectric. 
        The Ethiopian Electric Power Corporation (EEPCO), the state-owned firm 
        responsible for electricity generation, plans to construct several new 
        generating facilities to provide electricity to Ethiopia. Currently, less 
        than half of Ethiopia's towns have access to electricity though EEPCO 
        electrified more than eighty towns between 2001 and 2003. Since most of 
        Ethiopia's electricity is generated from hydroelectric dams, the country's 
        power system is vulnerable to extended droughts. Ethiopia recently endured 
        more than six months of power cuts due to low water levels in dams around 
        the country. Initially blackouts were scheduled once a week, but as the 
        drought wore on, customers lost power for 15 hours two days a week, a 
        situation that strained the resources of many businesses in urban centers. 
      </kw></p>
      <p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">EEPCO is rapidly expanding their generating capacity. The 73-MW Tis Abay 
        2 facility, located on the Blue Nile (Abay) came online in 2001. U.S.-based 
        Harza Engineering (now MWH Global) is overseeing the construction of an 
        additional 34-MW unit at the Finchaa hydroelectric facility in western 
        Ethiopia. EEPCO also plans to open the new 180-MW Gilgel Gibe hydroelectric 
        facility in October 2003. Gilgel Gibe, located on the Omo River in southwestern 
        Ethiopia, will increase the country's power capacity to 700-MW. EEPCO 
        has begun development of Ethiopia's largest generating facility at Tekeze. 
        The 300-MW hydroelectric facility will be located in northern Ethiopia 
        and will cost about $350 million. </kw></p>
      <p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">Construction of Ethiopia's first Independent Power Project (IPP) was 
        set to commence in early 2002. The Gojeb IPP will consist of a 150-MW

        by Mohammed International Development Research Organization &amp; Companies 
        (Midroc). When completed, Midroc will sell the output from Gojeb to EEPCO. 
        Agreements on additional IPP projects were signed in June 2001. The largest

        The Somali Republic gained independence on July 1, 1960. Somalia was formed 
        by the union of British Somaliland and Italian Somaliland. A socialist 
        state was established following a coup led by Major General Muhammad Siad 
        Barre. Rebel forces ousted the Barre regime in 1991, but turmoil, factional 
        fighting, and anarchy ensued. The Somali National Movement (SNM) gained 
        control of the north, while in the capital of Mogadishu and most of southern 
        Somalia the United Somali Congress achieved control.</kw></p>
      <p align="left"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">In 1992, responding to the political chaos and humanitarian disaster 
        in Somalia, the United States and other nations launched peacekeeping 
        operations to create an environment in which assistance could be delivered 
        to the Somali people. By March 1993, the potential for mass starvation 
        in Somalia had been overcome, but the security situation remained fragile. 
        On October 3, 1993 U.S. troops received significant causalities (19 dead 
        over 80 others wounded) in a battle with Somali gunmen. When the United 
        States (in 1994) and the UN withdrew (in 1995) their forces from Somalia, 
        after suffering significant casualties, order still had not been restored.</kw></p>
      <p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">A Transitional National Government (TNG) was created in October 2000 
        with the three-year mandate of creating a permanent national Somali government. 
        Although they declared their independence, the TNG does not recognize 
        Somaliland and Puntland as independent republics but has been unable to 
        reunite the country. Peace talks began in late-2002 and are ongoing. Somaliland 
        has refused to participate in these talks saying that while it would welcome 
        peace in former Italian Somalia, Somaliland is an independent country 
        awaiting international recognition.</kw></p>
      <p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">Somalia's economy, one of the world's least developed, has been further 
        hampered by the country's ongoing internal strife. Reliable economic data 
        is scarce, and the TNG cannot manage the national economy while it struggles 
        to gain control over the country. Livestock production (cattle, goats 
        &amp; sheep) is the mainstay and largest foreign exchange earner of the 
        Somali economy. An outbreak of Rift Valley Fever (RVF) in southern Saudi 
        Arabia and Yemen (the first reported outside Africa) in 2000 led six Gulf 
        States - Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Oman, Qatar, Yemen and the United Arab 
        Emirates - to ban livestock imports from the Horn of Africa. Middle Eastern 
        countries are considering lifting the ban on livestock in early 2004. 
        Another significant portion of the Somali economy, foreign remittances, 
        have fallen significantly following the US government's closure of the 
        Al-Barakat transfer company, which has been accused of transferring funds 
        on behalf of Osama bin Laden and the Al-Qaida terrorist network. Remittances 
        from abroad are estimated to be $200-$500 million annually.</kw></p>
      <p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">While the TNG is in the process of reestablishing Somalia's Central Bank.

        Somalia has no proven oil reserves, and only 200 billion cubic feet of 
        proven natural gas reserves. Somalia currently has no hydrocarbon production. 
        Oil seeps were first identified by Italian and British geologists during 
        the colonial era. Exploration activities were focused in northern Somalia, 
        and several foreign firms, including Agip, Amoco, Chevron, Conoco and 
        Phillips, held concessions in the area. The firms all declared force majeure 
        following the collapse of the central government.</kw></p>

        and the multiple sovereignty issues. In February 2001 Total signed an 
        exploration agreement with the TNG. The twelve-month agreement grants 
        Total the rights to explore in the Indian Ocean off southern Somalia. 
        Hassan Farah, TNG's Minister for Water and Mineral Resources, stated that 
        the government would provide security during the exploration activities. 
        Several factional leaders have denounced the agreement, and stated that 
        the TNG did not have the authority to sanction the agreement, nor the 
        power to guarantee the safety and security of the exploration operations.</kw></p>

        and two Chinese firms, CPEC and CPC, for the right to explore for oil. 
        Dubai-based Zarara Energy also signed an exploration agreement with Somaliland. 
        The Somaliland government has said it will honor, until they expire, the 
        existing contracts foreign companies signed with the Barre regime that 
        are in their territory. None of the firms have resumed operations in Somaliland.

        (ENEE) is the entity responsible for generation, transmission and distribution 
        of electricity in Somalia. Electrical infrastructure has been damaged 
        and destroyed, and the ongoing strife has hindered the development of 
        new electric resources. A planned hydroelectric facility on the Juba River 
        has been delayed due to the continued fighting. Studies have indicated 
        that the Horn of Africa, especially Somalia, is a prime location for harnessing
