Britain. In Geoffrey, the Breton royal family was closely related
to the British. He tells us that the Breton kingdom was founded
when the Roman emperor Maximianus (properly called Maximus, reigned
AD 383-88) bestowed the crown on Conan Meriadoc, a nephew of Octavius,
elsewhere called Eudaf, King of Britain. When the British wanted
a king, Conan's successor, Aldroenus, gave them Constantine, his
brother. Constantine was Arthur's grandfather. In the Arthurian
legend, King Hoel of Brittany was said to be Arthur's relation
and ally. Traditionally, this Hoel reigned from about AD 510-45.

<p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
A broch is a type of round, stone-walled farmhouse covered with
turf to make a smooth hill which is to be found in the ancient
Pictish areas of Scotland. The entrance to a broch is by a single
door, and they have no shaft connecting them with the outer air
such as are found in the howes. Inside are winding low passages
leading to several chambers. They are defensive rather than offensive
in design. R. W. Feachem considers that they were constructed
not by the Picts but by the Proto-Picts, the heterogeneous tribes
which were finally blended together to produce the Picts of history,
that mysterious people who contribute their part to the theories
of the fairy origins. These brochs, like other knolls and howes,
were often called Fairy knowes and play their part in sustaining
the theories of David Mac Ritchie.

</kw></p><h2><kw class="krdwrd-tag-mrgtie">BRODGAR, RING OF</kw></h2>
<p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
The Ring of Brodgar, Orkney, is a large stone circle, originally
comprising megaliths with a diameter of 103,7 m (125 megalithic
yards), and surrounded by a rock-cut ditch. Thought to be contemporary
with Maeshowe and the Stones of Stenness and to date from approx
2400 BC. Close to Harray Loch.


</kw></p><h2><kw class="krdwrd-tag-mrgtie">BRODICK (ARRAN)</kw></h2>

<p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
No fewer than 10 stone circles remain on the island of Arran,
Strathclyde, though it is clear that at one time there were many
others which have not survived the ravages of men and time. Seven
of the surviving circles are in the west, in the area around the
Black and Machrie waters, and almost all of them have been linked
with the legendary Fionn. Fionn, better known as Fingal, and linked
with the music-making cave of Staffa, would have found the construction
of circles from gigantic stones as relatively light work, for
in earlier times he was credited with the building of Fingal's
cave from basaltic blocks, as well as the construction of the
entire island of Staffa and the Giant's Causeway on the northern
coast of Ireland. Fionn of Celtic mythology was the son of a king
who was apprenticed to a magician.
</kw></p><p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
In the Celtic legends we learn how when this magician had caught
the wily old salmon of knowledge and had cooked it on his stove,
the young Fionn touched it with his thumb, burned it badly and
held it to his mouth in order to suck it. In this way Fionn became
possessed of all knowledge, and became conversant with the magical
lore. According to the old stories of Atlantis (of which the Northern
Islands are said to be remnants), the stone circles were built
by means of magic, for the ancient priests were supposed to have
the secret of anti-gravitational forces. Precisely why Fionn constructed
the circles remains a mystery: two of the smaller Arran circles
(one on Machrie Moor, the other at Aucheleffan) have their stones
orientated to the cardinal points, which has suggested that these
circles, like those at Stonehenge, were designed with calendrical
purposes in mind. A convenient centre from which to explore the
ancient circles and cairns is Brodick, from where roads lead to
within easy walking distance of the main centres. Seven miles
west of Brodick, on the west side of the island, is the Auchagallon
stone circle of 15 standing stones around a circular cairn. Six
miles south-south-west of Brodick is the chambered Cairn Ban,
some 900 feet above sea level, and consisting of a mound of stones
100 feet by 60 feet, with the facade and forecourt at the east
end. The chamber within is divided into three compartments each
of 15 feet length, with a slab roof set on corbelling at a height
of about eight feet. Three miles further SSW from Brodick is the
chambered cairn of Torrylin, in which were preserved the skeletal
remains of six adults and a child, along with the remains of otters,
birds and fish. Nine miles SW of Brodick at East Bennan, is a
chambered cairn roofed with large flat slabs over the 20foot gallery.
Seven miles outside Brodick is the chambered cairn known locally
as 'Giant's Grave'. A number of mysterious 'cup and ring' marks,
consisting of double concentrics with gullies issuing downwards,
as well as simple convex cups and triple concentrics, may be seen
on the exposed rock face on the hill above the highest part of
nearby Stronach Wood.

A guardian spirit of wild beasts that inhabits the Border Country.
Henderson quotes a story of an encounter with him sent by Mr Sutees
to Sir Walter Scott. Two young men were out hunting on the moors
near Elsdon in 1744, and stopped to eat and rest near a mountain
burn. The youngest went down to the burn to drink, and as he was
stooping down he saw the Brown Man of the Muirs on the opposite
bank, a square, stout dwarf dressed in clothes the colour of withered
bracken with a head of frizzled red hair and great glowing eyes
like a bull. He fiercely rebuked the lad for trespassing on his
land and killing the creatures that were in his care. For himself
he ate only whortleberries, nuts and apples. 'Come home with me
and see,' he said. The lad was just going to jump the burn when
his friend called him and the Brown Man vanished. It was believed
that if he had crossed the running stream he would have been torn
to pieces. On the way home he defiantly shot some more game and
it was thought that this had cost him his life, for soon after
he was taken ill, and within a year he died.

His territory extends over the Lowlands of Scotland and up into
the Highlands and Islands, all over the north and east of England
and into the Midlands. With a natural linguistic variation he
becomes the Bwca of Wales, The Highland Bodach and the Manx Fenodoree.
In the West Country, Pixies or Pisgies occasionally perform the
offices of a brownie and show some of the same characteristics,
though they are essentially different. In various parts of the
country, friendly Lobs and Hobs behave much like brownies. The
Border brownies are the most characteristic. They are generally
described as small men, about three feet in height, very raggedly
dressed in brown clothes, with brown faces and shaggy heads, who
come out at night and do the work that has been left undone by
the servants. They make themselves responsible for the farm or
house in which they live; reap, mow, thresh, herd the sheep, prevent
the hens from laying away, run errands and give good counsel at
need. A brownie will often become personally attached to one member
of the family. In return he has a right to a bowl of cream or
best milk and to a specially good bannock or cake. William Henderson
in FOLK LORE OF THE NORTHERN COUNTIES describes a brownie's portion:
He is allowed his little treats, however, and the chief of these
are knuckled cakes made of meal warm from the mill, toasted over
the embers and spread with honey. The housewife will prepare these,
and lay them carefully where he may find them by chance. When
a titbit is given to a child, parents will still say to him, 'There's
a piece wad please a Brownie.'

<p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
The rocks of Carningli, the rock of the angels, surmounted by
the remains of an Iron Age fort, stand at the western edge of
Mynydd Preseli in Pembrokeshire. To the north, the Afon Nyfer
joins the sea at Newport after flowing through the village of
Nevern, where the sixth-century Brynach made his settlement. A
tall Celtic cross still stands in the churchyard there. Brynach
was an Irishman, who left his native country to become a colleague
of David and soul friend of Brychan (q.v.), who was also to become
his father-in-law - for although the Celtic church made no insistence
on celibacy, Brychan is one of the few whose marriage is recorded.
It was indeed one of his wife's kinsmen, Clether, who gave him
the land around the banks of the Nyfer on which to make his settlement.
This Clether may well have been related to the fifthcentury Clutar,
who is named in both Irish and Latin ogham inscriptions on the
stone preserved inside the church at Nevern, on a window sill
at the eastern end of the nave. Legend has it that Carningli (the
rock of the angels) got its name because it was the place where
Brynach chose to spend time as a solitary hermit and was granted
angelic visions. Perhaps he went there because you can sometimes
see the Wicklow Hills from that height, and perhaps he chose to
live in a deserted hill fort in order to follow the example of
the first Christian hermit, Antony of Egypt, who lived for twenty
years in the deserted hill fort of Pispir. His feast-day is 7
April.

</kw></p><h2><kw class="krdwrd-tag-mrgtie">BRÅ, THE BRONZE CAULDRON FROM</kw></h2>

<p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
In February 1952 the discovery was made at Brå, near Horsens
in East Jutland, of well-preserved bronze animal figures, iron
rings, and a quantity of crumpled bronze sheeting. This heap of
metal had originally formed an immense bronze cauldron with an
iron rim, rim handles and an ornamentation of high artistic merit.
It had not been so thoroughly destroyed, however, as to make it
impossible to reconstruct its shape, which recalls that of other
Celtic cauldrons found in Denmark, at Rynkeby on Funen and at
Sophienborg in Zealand. Like these it bears bulls' heads, looking
outwards from below the rim; but the style of the decoration is
different, fresher and more expressive.
</kw></p><p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
As a summarise of the survey of early Celtic influence in the
Brå Find, Ole Klindt-Jensen writes in THE BRONZE CAULDRON
FROM BRÅ (# 373): 'A definite Celtic touch can first be noted
towards the end of Early La Tène, Ic, the very period to
which the Brå cauldron belongs. The Plastic style is imitated
on massive Danish bronze fibulae and torques, types which in all
other respects trace their ancestry to the earliest Iron Age or
the latest periods of the Bronze Age.
</kw></p><p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
The shield bosses of the Hjortspring hoard are influenced by the
earliest Celtic iron-plated bosses from La Tène Ic. Together
with a torque with signet-like terminals, the Brå cauldron
(and probably also the Mellerup beakers) represent the Celtic
imports from that period. It is therefore exeedindly probable
that the Brå cauldron was imported towards the end of La
Tène I, the period when we see clear evidence of influences
from Celtic culture.
</kw></p><p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
The Jastorf pottery, which in Sprockhoff's opinion imitates Celtic
ware from the beginnings of La Tène, has parallels in Denmark.
But, even if his working hypothesis is accepted in full, it is
nevertheless probable that this influence first made itself felt
in Denmark towards the end of La Tène I, for example via
the HunsrückEiffel group. As we have seen, the Plastic Style
(La Tène Ic) is found directly on objects of Halstatt tradition,
without any influence of the Early Celtic Style or of the Waldalgesheim
Style being discernible. In the course of La Tène II and
III the contacts between Denmark and the Celts were strengthened,
and even after the Celts lost their political independence they
remained a source of cultural inspiration to the peoples of the
north during the first two centuries AD.
</kw></p><p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
A variety of imported articles such as torques and belt sections
from Celtic and Celto-Germanic Middle La Tène can beseen
in Denmark, as well as the results of contemporary influences
on native torques, bronze belts and fibulae. It is possible, however,
that the lastnamed are later, from Late La Tène, the period
which par exellence reveals Celtic influence. The rich chariot-burial,
Grave A 1 at Kraghede, stands out as a distinguished example of
that period's work. It is perhaps the grave of a chieftain who
had especially good opportunities to obtain the coveted foreign
articles. In any case the grave furniture reveals a considerable
Celtic manufacture to objects showing Celtic features, such as
an iron fibula of Late La Tène type and the pottery drinking
vessel with a Celtic hunting scene carried out in dotted lines.
It is therefore remarkable that we do not see the beginnings of
Celtic art more clearly reflected in the Danish discoveries, which
otherwise have provided some of the most important specimens bearing
witness to Celtic culture's distinction and originality. Now to
the magnificent discoveries of a later period - the Gundestrup
cauldron, the Dejbjerg carts and the Rynkeby cauldron - is added
the Brå cauldron, the finest example known of Celtic Plastic
art, and at the same time evidence of important early connections
between the Celts and Denmark.

# 701: White sacrificial bulls embodied not only ancestral gods,
even the Druidic oak god, killed at the moment when the sacred
mistletoe was cut from the tree. A central shrine of this cult
in Britain was Bury Saint Edmunds, where the 'burial' seems to
have been the heads of the annually sacrificed bulls, and the
taurine god himself was incongruously canonized as Saint Edmund.
The monastery records show that the 'martyr' was incarnate every
year in a white bull, his virile powers adored by women who 'visit
the tomb of the glorious martyr St. Edmund to make oblation to
the same white bull.' - The Presbytery of Dingwall recorded pagan-style
bull sacrifices even as late as the seventeenth century on the
holy day of Diana in August, together with adoration of wells
and holed stones, and other local shrines listed as 'ruinous chapels'
or 'superstitious monuments.'

in Celtic rites; the animal was also ritually killed for divination.
There were the Three Bull Protectors of the Island of Britain
mentioned in one of the WELSH TRIADS and there was a three-horned
sacred bull. For the Druids the sacrificial white bull was the
sun, with the Cow the earth.

# 454: A primal symbol of strength
and potency, the bull is a frequent figure in British mythology.
It is possible that the bull was a special totemic animal of kingly
rule and that sacred herds of cattle played a prominent part in
ancient rituals. The 'Tarbh-feis,' or bullfeast was perhaps a
remnant of this understanding: among the Gaelic peoples, a white
bull was slaughtered and a druid would drink of its blood and
eat of its flesh in preparation for sleeping wrapped in the flayed
hide. His subsequent dreams would determine the rightful king
to be elected. The bull is the central cause of the 'Tain Bo Cuailgne'
(Cattle Raid of Cooley). The Isle of Man is haunted by the Taroo-Ushtey
or Water Bull, which, similar to the EACHUISGE is a beast to be
avoided or treated with caution for it can drag mortals into the
sea and drown them. The bull is also the shape into which a knight
is enchanted in the folk-story, 'The Black Bull of Norroway.'

Remarks of Professor Bury, regarding the Celtic world: 'For the
purpose of prosecuting that most difficult of all inquiries, the
ethnical problem, the part played by race in the development of
peoples and the effects of race-blendings, it must be remembered
that the Celtic world commands one of the chief portals of ingress
into that mysterious pre-Aryan foreworld, from which it may well
be that we modern Europeans have inherited far more than we dream.'

The Celts believed in fly-souls and butterfly-souls which, like
birdsouls, flew about seeking a new mother. It was thought that
women become pregnant by swallowing such creatures. In Irish myth,
Etain took the form of a butterfly for seven years, then entered
the drinking cup of Etar (Etarre), who swallowed her, and so brought
her to rebirth. In her second incarnation, Etain married Eochy,
the High King of Ireland. In Cornwall spirits still forms as white
butterflies.

(boobachod) The Welsh equivalent of the Brownies, whom they very
closely resemble both in their domestic helpfulness and their
capacity for obstreperous and even dangerous behaviour when they
are annoyed. According to Sikes in BRITISH GOBLINS, they have
one outstanding characteristic, which is their dislike of teetotallers
and of dissenting ministers. Sikes tells a story of a Cardiganshire
bwbach who took a special spite against a Baptist preacher, jerking
away the stool from under his elbows when he was kneeling, interrupting
his prayers by clattering the fire-irons or grinning in at the
window. Finally he frightened the preacher away by appearing as
his double, which was considered to be ominous of death. This
was a bogy or bogey-beast prank beyond the range of most brownies,
otherwise the Bwbach differed only linguistically. See also: BWCA.

<p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
(booka) A story collected by John Rhys in CELTIC FOLK LORE shows
how close the connection can be between the Brownie and Boggart,
or the Bwca and Bugan. Long ago a Monmouthshire farm was haunted
by a spirit of whom everyone was afraid until a young maid came,
merry and strong and reputed to be of the stock of the Bendith
y Mamau, and she struck up a great friendship with the creature,
who turned out to be a bwca, who washed, ironed and spun for her
and did all manner of household work in return for a nightly bowl
of sweet milk and wheat bread or flummery. This was left at the
bottom of the stairs every night and was gone in the morning;
but she never saw him, for all his work was done at night. One
evening for sheer wantonness she put some of the stale urine used
for a mordant in his bowl instead of milk. She had reason to regret
it, for when she got up next morning the bwca attacked her and
kicked her all over the house, yelling: 'The idea that the thick-buttocked
lass, should give barley-bread and piss, to the bogle!' After
that she never saw him again, but after two years they heard of
him at a farm near Hafod ys Ynys, where he soon made great friends
with the servant girl, who fed him most delicately with constant
snacks of bread and milk and played no unseemly pranks on him.
She had one fault, however, and that was curiosity. She kept on
asking to be allowed to see him and to be told his name - without
succes. One night, however, she made him believe that she was
going out after the men, and shut the door, but stayed inside
herself. Bwca was spinning industriously at the wheel, and as
he span he sang: 'How she would laugh, did she know that Gwarwyn-A-Throt
is my name.''Aha!' cried the maid, at the bottom of the stairs,
'now I have your name, Gwarwyn-a-Throt!' At which he left the
wheel standing, and she never saw him again.
</kw></p><p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">
He went to a neighbouring farm, where the farm-hand, Moses, became
his great friend. All would have gone well with poor Gwarwyn-a-Throt
but that his friend Moses was sent off to fight Richard Crookback
and was killed at Bosworth Field. After the loss of this friend
the poor bwca went completely to the bad and spent all his time
in senseless pranks, drawing the ploughing oxen out of the straight
and throwing everything in the house about at night-time. At length
he became so destructive that the farmer called in a Dyn Cynnil
(wise man) to lay him. He succeeded in getting the bwca to stick
his long nose out of the hole where he was hiding, and at once
transfixed it with an awl. Then he read an incantation sentencing
the bwca to be transported to the Red Sea for fourteen generations.
He raised a great whirlwind, and, as it began to blow, plucked
out the awl so that the poor bwca had changed his shape with his
nature, for brownies were generally noseless, and he was nicknamed
in this farm 'Bwca'r Trwyn', 'the Bwca with the Nose'.

According to Welsh legend, Arthur was killed with arrows at this
pass in Snowdonia whither he had pursued his enemies after a battle
at Tregalen. When he fell, his men went to a cave called Ogof
Lanciau Eryri where they had intended to wait until he came back.
A shepherd was once thought to have gained entrance to the cave
and seen them there. He found them armed with guns!
