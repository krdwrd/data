		<div class="byline"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">
		By </kw><a href="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/paulkiel.php"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1">Paul Kiel</kw></a><kw class="krdwrd-tag-1"> - June 18, 2007,  1:06PM</kw></div>
		<div class="body">
			<p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">President Bush has claimed that his executive powers allow him to bypass </kw><a href="http://www.boston.com/news/nation/washington/articles/2007/02/01/house_panel_probing_bushs_record_on_signing_statements/?rss_id=Boston.com+%2F+News+%2F+Nation"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">more than 1,100 laws</kw></a><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3"> enacted since he took office -- in what are called "signing statements." But what has been unclear ever since </kw><em><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">The Boston Globe</kw></em><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">'s landmark </kw><a href="http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2006/04/30/bush_challenges_hundreds_of_laws/?page=1"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">story</kw></a><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3"> on the statements (which won Charlie Savage a Pulitzer) is just what effect these obscure little statements, published in the federal register, have. </kw></p>

<p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">Sen. Robert Byrd (D-WV) and House Judiciary Chairman John Conyers (D-MI) wanted to know just that, so they asked for an analysis by the Government Accountability Office, the nonpartisan investigative arm of Congress, of last year's appropriations bills. The report, released today, is sure to lead to further investigation.</kw></p>

<p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">The agency examined a sample of appropriations bills from last year, focusing on 19 provisions that were affected by a presidential signing statement added to a bill -- in each case, Bush invoked the "unitary executive" theory or some other justification for disputing the bill. The result: of the 19 provisions, six were not executed as authorized by Congress.</kw></p>

			<p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">Now, there's a major asterisk to these findings in the report and that's this: "Although we found the agencies did not execute the provisions as enacted, we cannot conclude that agency noncompliance was the result of the President’s signing statements."</kw></p>

<p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">In other words, it's not clear that the agencies disobeyed the law </kw><em><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">because</kw></em><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3"> the president said they could disobey it. And it's also worth adding that of the six examples cited in the report, none of them have to do with the controversial assertions of presidential power dealing with issues of torture, domestic surveillance, etc. </kw></p>

<p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">But the report does strengthen the argument, originally </kw><a href="http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2006/04/30/bush_challenges_hundreds_of_laws/?page=7"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">made</kw></a><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3"> in Savage's piece, that bureaucrats might take the president's word over Congress' when implementing laws. And in issues as vital as the conduct of special operations, treatment of detainees, and others, that's a worrisome thought.</kw></p>

<p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">Both Conyers and Byrd, reacting to the report, are calling for more digging.</kw></p>

<p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">“This study calls for an extensive review of these practices, something the Administration has so far refused to do," says Conyers.</kw></p>

<p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">Sen. Byrd, saying that the "Administration cannot be in the business of cherry picking the laws it likes and the laws it doesn’t," said that the GAO report "underscores the fact that the Bush White House is constantly grabbing for more power, seeking to drive the people’s branch of government to the sidelines.... We must continue to demand accountability and openness from this White House to counter this power grab."</kw></p>

<p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">This President and his lackeys have asserted the unitary theory; and _fired_ US Attys who did not follow his lead. It is absurd to suggeset "it's not clear" they didn't follow the law because of teh President. Duh: Of course they did; if they ignored the President -- despite the law that said otherwise -- they would have met the same fate as the US Attys: _Mandatory firing/resignation_.</kw><br>

Don't we all Becca. Don't we all. The lack of outrage- that is what is so damn depressing. What the fuck has happened?! Everyone has just accepted that our government is here to fuck us over and nothing can be done about it. The Dems were given a golden opportunity to take back the White House and pick up seats in 08. Now they're less popular than Bush. Caving in on Iraq was a huge mistake. I've lost all hope and I don't think I'm the only one. Just give us some truth! </kw></p>

It's time we ALL start focusing on investigations into impeachment. Why are a majority of us ambivalent to discuss it? We're all off on our own little tangents? Our own little worlds? No wonder Molly Ivins once said, "Trying to organize liberals is like trying to herd cats."</kw></p>

<p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">People talk about how we don't have enough votes to remove Bush from office. Well, if memory serves me, they said the same thing when impeachment hearings began in '73. We all know the rest. They're saying the same excuses today as well. Just initiate the hearings and let the evidence come out. Then we'l know if it's worth it or not.</kw></p>

<p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">It took 8 months to investigate Nixon. It took 4 to investigate Clinton. WIth Bush &amp; Cheney, do you really think it's going to be as long? I don't think so. Look at all the evidence the media keeps uncovering. </kw></p>

<p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">It's time the Dems stop thinking about winning elections and start focusing on what's right and what's moral. What means more to us: gaining control of the House and Senate or preserving and protecting the Constitution from further abuse of power? Don't you think if we don't impeach, we're sending a bad message to future leaders and that they can get away with misusing power? Elections won't stop the hemorraging (sp.) of our country. Investigations into impeachment will. Impeachment isn't un-American. </kw></p>
