<p><b><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">"In much the same way that the British Empire tried to take over
Africa and profit from its wealth, corporations look at [teens] like this
massive empire they are colonizing.&nbsp; And their weapons are films,
music, books, CDs, internet access, clothing, amusement parks, sports teams."&nbsp;&nbsp;
Robert McChesney</kw></b>
</p><p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">1.&nbsp; Do "cool hunters" and those who use the information they supply
exploiting teens or providing desired benefits and services?
</kw></p><p><b><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">"They don't call it "human" research or "people" research, they call
it "market" research."</kw></b>
</p><p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">2.&nbsp; Did the marketers in The Merchants of Cool get it right?&nbsp;
Do they really know you?&nbsp; If MTV was really based on understanding
you as a person, what would it look like?
</kw></p><p><b><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">"The MTV machine doesn't listen to the young so it can make the young
happier.&nbsp; The MTV machine tunes in to figure out how to pitch what
Viacom has to sell."&nbsp; Mark Crispin Miller</kw></b>
</p><p><b><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">"Quite simply, every company with a powerful brand is attempting
to develop a relationship with consumers that resonates so completely with
their sense of self that they will aspire, or at least consent, to be serfs
under these feudal brandlords."&nbsp;&nbsp; Naomi Klein&nbsp; </kw><font size="-1"><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">*this
quote does not appear in the video</kw></font></b>
</p><p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">3.&nbsp; Naomi Klein argues that advertising has changed from sponsoring
culture to becoming culture (e.g., Sprite sponsoring a concert as opposed
to Sprite becoming a component of hip hop culture).&nbsp; What's the difference?&nbsp;
What happens to a culture when its purpose is sales rather than expression?
</kw></p><p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">4.&nbsp; Distinguished scholar George Gerbner has asserted that those
who control a society's stories have the power to shape the society's values.&nbsp;
Who has control over your stories?&nbsp; Who do you want to have that control?&nbsp;
Does who tells the story matter?&nbsp; Does MTV give an accurate voice
to your stories?&nbsp; How does commercial control (i.e. control by those
primarily interested in selling things) of media influence the kinds of
stories our society hears?
</kw></p><p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">5.&nbsp; Is the "mook" (the stereotypically crude, adolescent male)
real, or just a media construction?&nbsp; How about the "midriff" (the
girl as sex symbol)?&nbsp; Do you know any "mooks" or "midriffs"?
</kw></p><p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">6.&nbsp; Do you think you or your friends are influenced by the MTV
standard of "cool"?&nbsp; If so, how?&nbsp; Are there ways to be "cool"
without copying media?&nbsp; How do the "mook" and "midriff" stereotypes
relate to the corporate interests of the media outlets that perpetuate
them (in other words, why these stereotypes and not some other stereotype)?
</kw></p><p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">7.&nbsp; Many media observers have claimed that programs like Beverly
Hills 90210 or Dawson's Creek are popular because they are reflective of
teen life?&nbsp; In what ways are they reflective of how teenagers really
live and in what ways are they distortions?&nbsp; Do these shows mirror
how you live?
</kw></p><p><kw class="krdwrd-tag-3">8.&nbsp; Because they do so much research, media makers think they know
a lot about you.&nbsp; Consider whether you agree with the following assertions
from TMOC.&nbsp; "Sex is a part of teens lives so it better be in the media
too"&nbsp; "No teenager is going to be satisfied with a PG-13 rated horror
film.&nbsp; They want to see blood and guts.&nbsp; That's what they want
to do."
