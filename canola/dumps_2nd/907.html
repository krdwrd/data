    <td><h2><kw>A US VIEW OF DIGITAL AFRICA'S PROSPECTS - AN OFF-THE-RECORD BRIEFING</kw></h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><kw>Most of News Update's coverage is firmly
    rooted in ICT events in the African continent. For this issue, we've taken time out to
    visit the USA to see how Africa looks from the other side of the Atlantic. America is the
    richest and most powerful nation on the planet and what it does will affect the state of
    Africa. It plays host to a whole range of bodies whose budgets and work will impact on the
    state of digital development on the continent.</kw></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><kw>Digital divide issues in general - and
    those of Africa in particular - have had almost unprecedented attention in America. They
    have engaged some of the sharpest minds in the US technology sector. But after all the
    euphoria and policy hoopla, things now stand at a crucial crossroads. This is what the
    Americans might call "a heads-up" for Africa and a lot hangs on getting things
    right. If the private sector individuals see their efforts fail to make an impact, then
    Africa will be back to being 5-10 minutes at the end of a long world sales meeting.</kw></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><kw>In the course of our US visit we talked
    to a wide range of individuals drawn from very different backgrounds. In order that you
    can hear and understand their views and perceptions as clearly as possible, this briefing
    is provided on an "off-the-record basis": no views or quotes are attributed.</kw></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><kw>Even for the well-informed American
    citizen who reads the foreign news pages of the broad-sheet newspapers like the New York
    Times and the Washington Post, Africa has not really made a great deal of an impression
    except for famine and human interest stories. As one technology consultant who has done
    work in Africa put it: “It is very much off the radar in the US. The success of the
    Indian software industry has made quite an impression but the only thing in Africa to
    register has been the success of cell phones."</kw></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><kw>There has been renewed interest recently
    in the continent because of the visit by Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill and U2's Bono.
    There is talk of a new US$10 billion Millennium Fund but congressional approval has not
    yet been obtained. But whilst this is seen as good news in Africa, O'Neill is widely seen
    (according to one Washington insider) as an "entertaining lightweight" who
    allows his tongue to run ahead of his brain in making public statements.</kw></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><kw>His comments about Ugandan water wells
    go to the heart of a fundamental misunderstanding between America and Africa (and the
    wider donor and NGO community). Private sector people (of whom O'Neill is one) frequently
    ask: what are the metrics? In other words what are the numbers? By this they mean how can
    you quantify the problem you're trying to solve, what precisely are you going to do to
    solve it and why will it make a difference? Africans and the wider donor and NGO community
    tend to stress the complexity and intractability of the problems to be addressed: little
    surprise that they find it easy to sneer at what they see as the naiveté of someone
    wanting to cut through complexity to find solutions. But as one NGO person deeply involved
    in Africa admitted ruefully:"40 years of capacity building and what have we got to
    show for it?"</kw></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><kw>O'Neill in a speech last week on his
    African visit at Washington's Georgetown University stressed 3 priorities: education,
    water and health. He laid stress on the connection between aid, accountability and
    governance. However when pressed on the connection between this and American foreign
    policy implicitly admitted that "strategic partnerships" (as in the case of
    Pakistan) might override these principles.</kw></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><kw>This echoes a broader shift that will
    affect Africa. Before 9/11, it might have been possible to engage the Administration's
    attention but now the prospects are much less promising. Time and again people said what
    one observer of Government put forcefully: “Africa’s a bloody serious problem
    but we've got others more pressing on our hands elsewhere".</kw></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><kw>The idea of using ICT in places like
    Africa has produced a wide-ranging consensus between the private sector, donors,
    foundations and NGOs. The idea of ICT as a tool for development and economic growth is
    widely accepted and understood. The difficulty has been turning this policy consensus into
    decisive funding and investment decisions. As one foundation person put it, there's been a
    difficulty "productising" from this policy consensus: in other words how do you
    produce sustainable projects in either market or need terms? One private sector initiative
    has gone through all sorts of ideas but is finding it difficult to identify products or
    services that will make sense in commercial terms.</kw></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><kw>From the African perspective there is
    certain amount of suspicion of private sector involvement. Time and time again, we are
    asked: what's in it for them?</kw></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;" lang="EN-GB"><kw>There are three main reasons why individuals
    and companies in the technology sector in the US are interested in Africa:</kw></span></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><kw>*&nbsp;&nbsp; It represents an
    intellectual challenge: They are fascinated by the opportunity to see whether they can
    find solutions using technology and business savvy. They have the classic American
    "can do" attitude and relish the challenge. They have seen technology transform
    economies and lives in a different context and believe it might be possible to create this
    effect in Africa.</kw></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><kw>*&nbsp;&nbsp; It is enlightened
    self-interest: The mantra of "Smaller, cheaper, faster, better technology" means
    that it should reach a cost where emerging markets will begin to develop. One company is
    consciously looking to find a way of making sufficiently cheap devices that meet a need
    that will begin to create these new markets: “In a commercial sense, there's a need
    for growth (in Africa) and there's a market not being served." There's also a growing
    acknowledgement that innovation may now come from the South as well as developed countries
    as they begin to make use of new technologies. There's particular interest in wireless
    technologies which the USA has not really fully developed.</kw></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><kw>*&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a genuine, caring
    interest: There is a tradition of philanthropy and service in parts of US public life that
    for those elsewhere is sometimes hard to understand. For some, with wealth goes
    responsibility for others less fortunate.</kw></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><kw>But now the excitement of the early love
    affair between the tech sector and Africa is over and they are beginning to see the
    incompatibilities in the relationship.</kw></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><kw>One quoted a country in Africa where the
    government changed (through elections) and the present administration seems to be
    systematically tearing up all the contract commitments made by its predecessors:
    "This is not a basis for long-term external investment". They are also appalled
    by the daunting obstacles of the African legal system for anything contractual or
    regulatory in business terms. African governments need to understand that they are still
    placing enormous obstacles in front of those wanting to invest: some of the recent telco
    privatisation processes are viewed as being particularly opaque.</kw></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><kw>They are beginning to see the
    difficulties of creating business ideas that will "scale-up" in a continent of
    small markets and very limited management cadres. Why do these business ideas need to
    scale-up? Because if you put money in you will need to be making investments on a
    sufficient scale to make adequate returns to justify your original investments. Therefore
    Africa is stuck in an unbearable double bind: its ICT markets are too small to justify
    large-scale investment but without large-scale investment they have little or no chance of
    getting larger. What the US tech minds are trying to find is a pivotal key investment that
    will unlock other streams of growth in these markets.</kw></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><kw>All those we spoke to believed that the
    creation of more competition remains essential. There are many US tech and telco companies
    doing business in Africa but only a few are doing so in a ways that are helping to change
    the shape of the business environment by introducing new competition or extending
    services.</kw></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><kw>They have also begun to understand the
    difficulties of working in markets where government is such a large part of the
    environment and potentially one of the biggest customers. As you would expect, Government
    doesn't behave with commercial instincts and it has simply too many priorities to be
    decisive about creating ICT strategies for change. African governments ought to be able to
    harness this private sector interest to attract external investment but all too often they
    treat external investors as if they were donors to be parted from their money. US tech
    people find this worrying and are unlikely to fall for it.</kw></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><kw>The policy consensus referred to above
    has been forged through a range of bodies that have brought governments,
    inter-governmental organizations, the private sector, NGOs and charitable foundations
    together: the G8 Dot Force (reaching the end of its time-limited existence), the UN ICT
    Task Force and the Markle Foundation's Digital Opportunity Initiative being amongst the
    more significant.</kw></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><kw>For these great big policy leviathans,
    it's the end of the beginning. They've agreed in broad terms where they'd like to go and
    the route forward has been mapped out. But it's like a large plane has taken off but is
    now having difficulty finding places to land. As they start to "engage gears" at
    a country level, they are finding it harder to take next step to implementation. Sure,
    there's no shortage of projects but how do you find those that will make the differences
    claimed in the much-trumpeted advocacy examples given in your analysis?</kw></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><kw>Americans use the expression
    "getting traction" to express the idea that something is actually beginning to
    be successful in market terms and the phrase recurred in several conversations. One of the
    confusions is that the NGO/donor sector (for all its talk about sustainability) is
    actually looking at social projects that have little or no chance of making profits as
    they meet social needs outside the market, whilst the private sector believes that in
    order to grow these markets you have to find things that will make a profit. There are
    occasionally projects that seem to have the potential to bridge this divide: they meet
    social needs but are capable of being offered at on or near market prices. We came across
    two; one involves health reporting and the other concerned with satellite communications
    for remote areas. There are probably more out there. That said, four consistent criteria
    for ICT projects come through from all sides: "Sustainability, replicability,
    scalability and affordability."</kw></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><kw>The UN ICT Task Force is bidding to
    inherit the mantle of the (shortly to finish) G8 Dot Force. It has no funding but is
    trying use the UN's respected neutrality to act as a broker between projects and funders.
    In theory this should be a good role and they certainly "talk the talk".</kw></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><kw>However because it is a UN body it is
    unable to provide straightforward "leadership by ideas": it is not able to say
    to countries that there are things that will make you more successful. The more thoughtful
    senior personnel in inter-governmental organisations realise this and are somewhat
    frustrated. As one put it: "It's necessity to show intellectual leadership in the
    process but there's not much sign that's happening."</kw></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><kw>There is no doubting the sincerity of UN
    ICT Task Force's commitment but there are those that question its effectiveness. One
    person closely involved in the process told us: "Important private sector executives
    on the Task Force are pissed off and are talking of taking a walk". Put at its
    harshest, inter-governmental bodies want the money the private sector can bring but don't
    want to give it any real influence either in ideas or policy terms.</kw></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><kw>The source of the private sector's
    frustration is old-style UN behaviour - national interest lobbying, over-elaborate formal
    processes, bureaucratic time-scales and the issuing of lofty statements. They fear that
    the lack of emphasis on action is the disease, not the symptom. They feel there is a
    patronising attitude to private sector involvement, particularly in the&nbsp; context of
    the World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS). (See report on the African regional
    meeting in Bamako below). They want them to be involved but will not allow them to
    circulate papers spelling out their ideas to others involved.</kw></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><kw>Several people (from the private sector,
    NGOs and intergovernmental organisations) openly wondered what this long and convoluted
    process that will only finally conclude in 2005 will achieve. Cynics in the development
    community noted that this was only two years before the 2007 poverty targets are meant to
    be met, leaving not much time for "the information society" to actually make any
    impact on them. If this is really a democratic process (which we doubt) then it is not
    really very effective. As one private sector initiative executive commented: "They
    need to manage by objectives and do something more meaningful than simply issuing more
    damn proclamations."</kw></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><kw>Put plainly, he means they have to
    define achievable objectives and indicate where the money is coming from to meet them.
    Meanwhile all is not well with ICT initiatives in the NGO sector in the US. Two "new
    wave" digital divide organisations are in financial trouble from lack of funding and
    one with a major initiative in the making is financially stretched. Another merged with a
    long established organisation not so long ago because of the difficulties of fundraising
    as a new organisation. And yet another recently cut its staff by a third because of the
    downturn in charitable giving. The funding climate is currently not very favourable for
    new ICT initiatives according to one well-informed trust officer: “A combination of
    the dotcom bubble burtsing and 9/11 have meant that priorities have shifted in this
    country."</kw></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><kw>Nevertheless as with the private sector,
    there's considerable interest in what lessons might be learned from new technologies in
    the African context: “There’s lots of people in rural America interested in
    experiments in wireless provision and eagerly awaiting to see how these initiatives play
    out in places like Africa." The underlying problem is perhaps best summarised by one
    person with several years African experience under his belt in both consultancy and
    government: “Anything we have (in technology terms), you can get in Africa. There's
    no chasm out there called the digital divide that you fall down.</kw></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><kw>It's the 'haves' and the 'have-nots'
    distributed geographically in different ways. There are highly skilled people in Africa.
    The telephone provision statistics are improving dramatically. The general problem is who
    can afford it". The challenge for those wanting to change Africa's prospects through
    ICT is how to work with the energy and potential created by recently policy initiatives in
    ways that will open new prospects for its have-nots.</kw></p>
    <h2><kw>REPORT FROM BAMAKO: AFRICA STAKES A CLAIM TO BEING PART OF THE WORLD INFORMATION
    SOCIETY </kw></h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><kw>African ICT leaders converged in Bamako
    Mali on May 28-30 at the invitation of President Alpha Oumar Konare with one
    objective&nbsp; - to assess key challenges, opportunities and constraints and develop a
    common vision and a plan of action to address the challenges of an information society for
    Africa.&nbsp; After three days, the 51 countries assembled came up with a declaration on
    the framework for the long march into the information society as a negotiating platform at
    the World Summit of the Information Society (WSIS) to take place in Geneva in 2003, writes
    Muriuki Muriethi.</kw></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><kw>The African Regional Conference also
    known as a Bamako 2002&nbsp;&nbsp; made declarations on the following issues:</kw></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><kw>- That global information society
    address the interests of all nations big and small.</kw></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><kw>- Local content have space in the
    information society and indeed be accorded high priority.</kw></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><kw>- There must be a guarantee of fair
    access for African people.</kw></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><kw>- To create partnerships to build the
    global information society without leaving out the small and medium-sized enterprises
    (SMEs).</kw></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><kw>Bamako 2002 also set out principles to
    achieve the declarations cited above that;</kw></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><kw>- All citizens be provided with means of
    using ICT networks as a public service.</kw></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><kw>- Every citizen be guaranteed freedom of
    expression and protected access to information in the global public domain as part of an
    inalienable right to access information constituting a heritage of mankind.</kw></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><kw>- The technology supply is diversified
    by removal of regulatory, political, and financial obstacles to meet to the needs of the
    citizens.</kw></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><kw>- Promote free software to spread
    technology at least cost The full statement is available at: </kw><a href="http://www.geneva2003.org/bamako2002/docs_word/Dec_bko2002_en.doc"><kw>http://www.geneva2003.org/bamako2002/docs_word/Dec_bko2002_en.doc</kw></a></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><kw>Bamako 2002 was organised under the
    patronage of Kofi Annan, UN Secretary General under Resolution (A/RES/56183) promulgated
    by the UN on Dec 21</kw><sup><kw>st</kw></sup><kw> 2001. The resolution sets the framework to convene a
    World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) with an objective to formulate a common
    vision and understanding of the global information society. WSIS is expected to adopt a
    declaration of principles and an Action Plan to facilitate effective development of
    information society and help bridge the digital divide and to be held in two phases. Phase
    1 will take place in Geneva in Dec 2003 while the second phase will be in Tunis in 2005.
    The UN selected the International</kw></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><kw>Telecommunications Union (ITU) as the
    technical agency to lead the WSIS process. Bamako 2002 was therefore a key entry point for
    Africa into WSIS process with themes based around Information society and
    Africa&nbsp;&nbsp; ­ what it can get, give, preserve or benefit from the information
    society Bamako 2002 did not start with empty plate. On the table, Africa had the African
    Information Society Initiative (AISI) (</kw><a href="../aisi.htm"><kw>http://www.uneca.org/aisi/aisi.htm</kw></a><kw>)
    launched in 1996 as a framework to the information society. The vision is an information
    society by 2010.</kw></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><kw>*&nbsp;&nbsp; Defining the information
    society</kw></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><kw>Out the outset, there was a concern that
    the Information Society was still evolving and Africa has not made a rendezvous to dock in
    the fast moving Information society. An even greater difficulty&nbsp; was a working
    definition for the information society. Yoshiu Utsumi, Secretary General of ITU offered
    a&nbsp; definition as a society that will exhibit or experience the following features:</kw></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><kw>- Freedom from tyranny of distance.</kw></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><kw>- Economy of scale will no longer
    important.</kw></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><kw>- Death of hierarchical distribution of
    products and services.</kw></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><kw>African with up to 70% of its population
    in the rural areas face challenges that can be addressed by the information society as
    defined above. From that perspective, Bamako 2002 set out the terms for Africa to be a
    player in the information society, to benefit from the opportunities provided, and to seal
    the digital divide.</kw></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><kw>At the regional level, there are many
    initiatives taking place in Africa designed to encourage an information society. These
    initiatives tend to be tied to institutions not the broader cause of obtaining the
    information society and are therefore tending to work in isolation.&nbsp; An initiative by</kw></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><kw>Ministers of Communications in Africa -
    African Connection (</kw><a href="http://www.africanconnection.org/"><kw>http://www.africanconnection.org</kw></a><kw>)
    is intended to create a common ground among the many initiatives and marry the initiatives
    to a cause, not to an institution. African connection has noted the striking features of
    e-readiness surveys at national level. One country for example carried out six surveys
    with different e-readiness tools and unfortunately, the outcomes are so markedly different
    to be unlikely to be beneficial.</kw></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><kw>However by and large, countries
    themselves have not been left out of the processes of creating an information society.
    Sixteen countries, big and small, took to the podium to share their experiences and
    visions at the national level in the quest for an information society. The size of the
    network did not deter them from aspiring to build an information society.</kw></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><kw>Despite a relatively smaller
    infrastructure, Central Africa Republic is struggling and dreaming of an Information
    Society for its 3.4 million population. Being a land locked country, creating an
    information society is the way to go by exploiting: e-commerce, distance learning and
    telemedicine. Using these tools, it can overcome the disadvantage of being landlocked with
    its network of 8,000 fixed lines, 14,000 cellular connections and 2 cyber cafe’s On
    the other hand, Zimbabwe indicated that it has already launched a comprehensive
    e-readiness survey. The outcome will guide the deployment of a coordinated strategy to
    launch a Knowledge economy (K-economy). According to the Deputy Minister of Transport and
    communications, the government will launch an e-awareness week to popularise the quest for
    a "k-economy".</kw></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><kw>In all the presentations, the key
    challenge is where to place the championship of the information society within the
    government. While many countries see information society as a telecommunication
    infrastructure issue and therefore placed under the ambit of the ministry responsible for
    telecommunications, others saw it as a science and technology issue. A growing number of
    countries have elevated it to a higher national level. Mali the host country recognise
    information society as cross cutting issue that best functions at higher level: the Prime
    Minister is in charge of it.</kw></p>
    <h4 style="text-align: justify;"><kw>*&nbsp;&nbsp; DIGITAL DIVIDE - A HYPE
    TO SIDETRACK AFRICA FROM DEVELOPMENT?</kw></h4>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><kw>One unanswered question was whether
    digital-divide is more than simply "hype" that will sidetrack Africa while the
    key issue is a development-divide.&nbsp; While the lack of ICT infrastructure is glaringly
    obvious, this is also true for other sectors of socio-economic development in Africa and
    there is perhaps too much emphasis on it at the expense of the other developmental goals.
    This tends to narrow down and over-simplify a huge national and regional development
    challenge to a sectoral development objective whereas the one (ICT) should be seen a
    subset of the other (development).</kw></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><kw>An interesting dimension of the
    information society discussions was the human rights aspect and recognition that the core
    business of information society is information and knowledge.&nbsp; By moving information
    and knowledge into the private domain through an Intellectual Property Rights regime
    protected by copyrights laws, Africa may become locked out from its own information.
    Additionally, the wholesale privatisation of the means of access to information (telecom
    infrastructure, internet and broadcasting etc) would lock out&nbsp; access by the poor.
    The two components ­ control of information and knowledge on one hand and the control of
    the means of access are critical for Africa to participate meaningfully in the information
    society. Bamako 2002 did not fully address the ownership of information and knowledge but
    declared information to be a fundamental human right that WSIS has to guarantee. No
    mechanism was addressed to reconcile this fundamental human right to information with
    profit driven, private sector entrepreneurship in the delivery of information.</kw></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><kw>Infrastructure was repeatedly recognised
    as critically lacking. Data provided by ITU depicted chilling statistics. Despite the fast
    growth in the last few years, the penetration for fixed, mobile and the Internet was still
    very low in Sub Sahara Africa (SSA).&nbsp; Forecast penetration in SSA by 2005 for
    Internet, mobile and fixed would be a paltry 0.58, 1.22 and 1.1. More still needs to be
    done to alter the pattern of growth.&nbsp; Due to poverty in the region, a way forward
    would be to address affordability and which calls for the reduction of the cost of the
    technology. Africa effectively "rents" its technology because it has to rely on
    organisations on outside Africa to provide it and therefore cannot control costs of
    technology.&nbsp; A way out according to Jan Mutai, Secretary General of African
    Telecommunications Union was to gradually build a research capacity in Africa, create or
    join existing standardisation bodies as the key to eventually getting out this "rent
    position".</kw></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><kw>In the meantime, however, Africa should
    move with what it has. It took 5 years to build 30 million cellular lines, it should use
    the next few years to build another 30 million Internet connections to launch itself on
    the information society highway.</kw></p>
    <h4 style="text-align: justify;"><kw>*&nbsp;&nbsp; SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITIES
    FOR THE PRIVATE SECTOR</kw></h4>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><kw>For the private sector, this is an on
    opportunity. It can build the massive networks like WASC by Alcatel with a high profile
    presence at the conference or build applications with emerging entrepreneurs. A growing
    opportunity is the exploitation of offshore ICT back-office work for developed countries.</kw></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><kw>The Senegalese President announced the
    launch of the first undersea cable (WASC) linking West Africa to Asia through South Africa
    on May 27th, a day before the conference. This is a milestone for the delivery of the
    increased bandwidth to Africa.&nbsp; In the skies above, Rascom is due to launch two
    satellites costing US$400M at 249¹ east to be managed by Rascomstar registered offshore
    in Mauritius. The ownership of Rascomstar comprise of 30 African telcos with an equity of
    US$41M, GPTC of Libya US$42M, Alcatel with US$18M as major players. Signatures on the
    contract for the manufacture of the satellite is due within next few weeks.</kw></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><kw>A significant step has been taken to
    bring bandwidth to&nbsp;&nbsp; Africa through WASC, more however will need to be done to
    bring the same in Eastern Africa with no submarine cable being plan in the near term and
    more significantly to extend the bandwidth inland.</kw></p>
    <h4 style="text-align: justify;"><kw>*&nbsp;&nbsp; OAU ABSENT FROM THE TABLE</kw></h4>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><kw>After the serious discussion at the
    conference, one was left wondering what African institutions can bring on board to build
    the information society. The OAU and all its agencies apart from African
    Telecommunications Union did not participate. The same African political leadership who
    participated in UN Resolution A/RES/56183 establishing the WSIS process failed to remind
    the OAU to participate in Bamako. This is disheartening considering that EU was at the
    high table promoting the interest of European region. As Africa moves to recreate the OAU
    as the African Union in July 2002, Africans are keenly hoping to see proactivity from this
    premier organisation in African economic renaissance.</kw></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><kw>Another feature was the high
    representation of the Francophie in the conference, something not commonly found in other
    African conferences. Indeed Boutros Boutrous-Ghali the Secretary General of the Agence
    Internationale de la Francophonie was present in person and addressed the opening
    ceremony. The flip side of course, was that the leadership of the Anglophonie was
    noticeably absent. The Commonwealth was not there but you might question whether its
    presence necessary?</kw></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><kw>Despite its flaws, Bamako 2002 was a
    serious attempt to take stock of the challenges towards the evolution of an information
    society and prepare a foundation for future decisions on WSIS. For his foresight,
    President Alpha Konare deserves credit by taking the challenge and offering Africa a
    platform to negotiate itself a stake in the WSIS process. No doubt in appreciation of
    this, the conference called for his appointment to lead the preparatory process to Geneva
    2003. In hindsight, Mali sitting astride the harsh Sahara desert and among the poorest
    country in the world rekindled the thoughts of the poor continent of Africa in the world
    arena. Despite the poverty, Mali stood tall to invite Africa and took the initiative to
    bring Africa on the table. This table was near Timbuktu (or more correctly Tombouctou) at
    the edge of the Sahara and a major crossroad to the prosperous north under the Songhai
    Empire in 14</kw><sup><kw>th</kw></sup><kw> century. By then Timbuktu was a leading terminus giving hope for
    trans-Saharan caravans as they headed in the uncharted terrain of the Sahara desert in
    search of prosperity. 500 years later, Mali gives hope in the uncharted and fast evolving
    information society and a challenge to the poorest continent&nbsp;&nbsp; to stand up tall
    on WSIS table to stake its claim in the information society.</kw></p></td>
