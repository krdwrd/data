Doesn't Know</kw></b></u></p><p><kw>The
first time it had been an accident. They were on a routine mission,
searching for a new mutant whose family hadn’t been able to handle
her natural bright pink hair and purple eyes. She had the power to
wake the dead, literally. The professor sent Logan and Jean to get
her, believing they would be best for the job.</kw></p><p><kw>Scott
and Rogue hadn’t liked it, but they didn’t complain. They trusted
their lovers to be faithful, and the professor knew what he was
doing. But, as these things usually go, Scott and Rogue had been
right not to trust their significant others alone. Logan and Jean had
only been in Michigan for ten minutes before the close proximity in
the X-van was too much. By the time they’d finished, Elly – the
mutant – had been taken by Magneto.</kw></p><p><kw>Professor
Xavier wasn’t too happy about this, but he was much too worried
about Magneto’s future plans to really lecture them on not paying
close enough attention. Besides, the guilty looks they kept shooting
each other were enough to tell him they understood the repercussions
of their actions. Surely, they would think twice before doing it
again, right?</kw></p><p><kw>Wrong.</kw></p><p><i><kw>Hey!
</kw></i></p><p><i><kw>Scotty
doesn't know,</kw><br><kw>That Fionna and me,</kw><br><kw>Do it in my van every Sunday.</kw></i></p><p><kw>The
X-van was much too alluring, and every Sunday they made their way to
the garage while Kurt dragged the other X-men to church. As Jean was
not Catholic, she told Scott she was going to a Methodist church, and
Logan would just grunt that he was going out to drink. Nothing too
unusual there, it was what they always did. But Scott and Rogue had
an idea that something else was up. Jean was the only non-Catholic
that refused to go with them.</kw></p><p><kw>Still,
they didn’t say anything. To each other or to their lovers, too
afraid were they that their suspicions might be true. But Logan and
Jean would never cheat on them. They loved them! They told them so
every night.</kw></p><p><kw>But
love didn’t stop Jean from pleasuring Logan with her mouth in ways
that only Rogue had ever done before. And it didn’t stop Logan from
taking Jean in ways that she was sure Scott didn’t even know about.
And the best part of their affair was that Rogue and Scott didn’t
know.</kw></p><p><i><kw>She
tells him she’s in church,</kw><br><kw>But she doesn't go,</kw><br><kw>Still she’s
on her knees, and... </kw></i></p><p><i><kw>Scotty
doesn’t know, oh.</kw><br><kw>Scotty doesn't know-oh.</kw><br><kw>So don't tell
Scotty!</kw><br><kw>Scotty doesn't know,</kw><br><kw>Scotty doesn't know.</kw><br><kw>SO DON'T
TELL SCOTTY!</kw></i></p><p><kw>It
was official. Scott and Rogue knew it was. They didn’t know that
the other knew, but they knew. And no one else knew that they knew.</kw></p><p><kw>The
looks Storm and the others would give them were dead giveaways that
they knew about Logan and Jean, but they didn’t want to tell either
of them. They were too afraid of Scott losing his mind, or Rogue
breaking. Rogue was fragile after all, and Jean was all that kept
Scott’s mind together. But that was far from true. They knew, and
they were just fine. Well, except for the heartbreak anyway.</kw></p><p><i><kw>Fionna
says she’s out shopping,</kw><br><kw>But she’s under me and I'm not
stopping. </kw></i></p><p><i><kw>Cuz
Scotty doesn't know,</kw><br><kw>Scotty doesn't know,</kw><br><kw>Scotty doesn't
know,</kw><br><kw>Scotty doesn't know.</kw><br><kw>So don't tell Scotty.</kw><br><kw>Scotty
doesn't knoooooow...</kw><br><kw>DON'T TELL SCOTTY!</kw></i></p><p><kw>Jean
told him she was going shopping, and Logan told her he was going to
the local bar. That was a crock. It was obvious to everyone where
they were really heading, to the nearest motel they could find. They
wanted each other, but there were too many people around, including
their better halves. It was even more obvious to Rogue and Scott
because Jean would always ask Scott if he wanted her to pick him up
anything while she was out, and Logan would always wheedle Rogue
about joining him. This time they didn’t.</kw></p><p><i><kw>I
can't believe he's so trusting,</kw><br><kw>While I'm right behind you
thrusting. </kw></i></p><p><i><kw>Fionna's
got him on the phone,</kw><br><kw>and she's trying not to moan.</kw><br><kw>It's a
three-way call,</kw><br><kw>and he knows nothing.</kw><br><kw>NOTHING!</kw></i></p><p><kw>Scott
called her once, while they were together. He could hear the soft
sound of skin slapping skin through the phone, and the way her voice
sounded he could tell it was all she could do not to moan. Rogue had
passed by and, still having Logan’s sensitive hearing, had heard
exactly what was going on, perhaps better than Scott who had the
phone to his ear. She shot him a soft, sympathetic smile and left,
while he hurriedly hung up with Jean, hoping that Rogue hadn’t
heard what was going on.</kw></p><p><kw>He
didn’t think much of the smile she’d shot him; they were becoming
far too common lately. At first he’d thought she knew too, but then
he quickly erased that idea. She’d been looking at him differently
lately, ever since Jean and Logan found pleasure in each other. He
knew it was because Logan wasn’t as into it as he used to be, he
didn’t care as much for Rogue's pleasure as he did his own anymore
. It was because of Jean. He tasted the redhead and became addicted.
It was much the same for Scott, so he could respect her attention
wandering from the hairy jerk to him.</kw></p><p><i><kw>We'll
put on a show; everyone will go.</kw><br><kw>Scotty doesn't know,</kw><br><kw>Scotty
doesn't know,</kw><br><kw>Scotty doesn't knoooooow...</kw></i></p><p><kw>They’d
gone out to a play together, he and Rogue. It was part of their
evolving relationship, though they still refused to tell the other
that Logan and Jean were being unfaithful. They didn’t want to be
the cause of heartbreak for each other. They knew Logan and Jean were
busy back at the mansion, alone. Everyone else had business elsewhere
this week, so they were more than happy to keep each other away from
there for a while.</kw></p><p><kw>They
may not have known that they were not alone in their knowledge of
their cheating loves, but they did know one thing. Their relationship
was changing. And they really, </kw><i><kw>really </kw></i><kw>liked where it was
heading.</kw></p><p><i><kw>The,
parking lot, why not?</kw><br><kw>It's so cool when you're on top.</kw><br><kw>His
front lawn, in the snow.</kw><br><kw>Laughing so hard, cuz...</kw></i></p><p><kw>They
caught them in the parking lot once. Rogue had been coming from one
side and Scott from the other, so when they turned and ran, they
never saw each other. They only knew one thing. It had to end. They
would have to break the news once and for all, lest their friend find
out the hard way.</kw></p><p><kw>So,
for days and weeks they planned how they would say it. It was finally
Rogue, on Scott’s birthday no less, who came to him. He knew the
moment she walked into the room that she knew, that she’d known,
and he could’ve slapped himself for being so stupid. Rogue was far
from stupid, and she sure as hell wasn’t blind. </kw><i><kw>Of course</kw></i><kw>
she would know!</kw></p><p><kw>Logan
and Jean had left again, another motel. It was only more salt to the
wound that it was on his birthday, and they were no doubt getting a
good laugh at his blindness to her infidelity. He didn’t care
though; he’d been meaning to talk to Rogue for a while now. He had
a question, and he was pretty sure her answer would be yes.</kw></p><p><i><kw>Scotty
doesn't know,</kw><br><kw>Scotty doesn't know.</kw></i></p><p><i><kw>I
did her on his birthday.</kw></i></p><p><i><kw>Scotty
doesn't know,</kw><br><kw>Scotty doesn't know,</kw><br><kw>Scotty doesn't know,</kw><br><kw>Scotty
doesn't know,</kw><br><kw>Don't tell Scotty.</kw><br><kw>Scotty doesn't knoooooow...</kw></i></p><p><kw>“Scott,”
Rogue sighed deeply, “there’s somethin’ Ah gotta tell ya,
sugah.”</kw></p><p><kw>“Is
it about Jean and Logan?” he smiled at her surprised expression,
and it only grew when she smiled back.</kw></p><p><kw>“Ah
shoulda guessed. How could Ah be so stupid as t’ think you didn’t
know already? It ain’t like yo’ stupid or anythin’.” Rogue
laughed at her silliness. Here she’d been so worried about him
finding out, and he’d known all along. It seemed she was just as
clueless as the rest of the X-men.</kw></p><p><kw>“It’s
okay Rogue, I was trying to hide it from you too.” he winked. “Now,
I was thinkin’…would you by any chance…like to go to Alaska
with me? I heard that you always wanted to go there, and it </kw><i><kw>is </kw></i><kw>my
home state…”</kw></p><p><kw>“Alaska?”
Rogue’s eyes took on a dreamy tint. “Ah hear it’s beautiful up
there.”</kw></p><p><kw>“It
is. So, what d’ya say?”</kw></p><p><kw>“Ah
say, when d’ we leave?”</kw></p><p><kw>“Anytime
you want. We can go now if you’d like,” Scott stood and swung
Rogue around, smiling as her sweet laughter filled the room. She was
