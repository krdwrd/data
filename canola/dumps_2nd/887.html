<img src="../../../images/misc/Home%20Title.gif" alt="The Seattle Seafair Pirates Official Web Site - Pirate Kings of the Northwest since 1949  It's a high-humored heist by the Seattle SEAFAIR Pirates. The salty troupe's shenanigans and formidable float, the Duck, have become synonymous with SEAFAIR revelry. The Pirates, originally members of the Washington State Press Club's Ale &amp; Quail Society, banded together in 1949 to promote Seattle and Seafair while having fun and serving the community. Despite their bad-guy image, the Pirates make dozens of appearances annually to hospitals and nursing homes. During the height of Seattle's SEAFAIR Celebration, they appear at several events and parades each day.  The 40+ Pirates are an elite troupe who carefully selects their members based on their ability to mix well with the public and for their unique musical or theatrical talents.

<p style="margin-left: 25px; margin-right: 25px;"><b><font color="#000080" face="Arial"><br><kw>
Goodness me, is it July already?&nbsp; It seems 'Just months ago I was packing
my bags and heading for the far north-west of America to be with my dear
friends, the Seattle Seafair Pirates, to celebrate Seafair in Seattle. And it
seems lust a few weeks ago that they were here in Grand Cayman in the British
West Indies for our Pirates Week. It really was last October doesn't time fly!!!</kw></font></b>
</p><p style="margin-left: 25px; margin-right: 25px;" align="justify"><b><font color="#000080" face="Arial"><kw>It
does get a bit more difficult to write about the Seafair festival and our
Pirates Week festival each year&nbsp; so, I thought I would present to you some
of my memories both in Cayman and in Seattle about the Seafair Pirates.</kw></font></b></p>
<p style="margin-left: 25px; margin-right: 25px;" align="justify"><b><font color="#000080" face="Arial"><kw>My
first Seafair was way back in 1986 when Jim "the Greek" Makos was
Captain Kidd. His favorite saying was "Suck 'em up," referring to what
his crew must do</kw><br><kw>
at the various watering holes we stopped at where we were entertaining. Even
though I am a part time actor I did feel out of my depth. These guys [the
pirates]</kw><br><kw>
seemed the genuine article. I had met some of them twice before in Cayman but
that was on my home turf. This was very different on theirs.</kw></font></b></p>
<p style="margin-left: 25px; margin-right: 25px;" align="center"><b><font color="#000080" face="Arial">&nbsp;<a href="images/duke.jpg"><img src="images/duke_small.jpg" alt="duke.jpg (76067 bytes)" border="0" height="153" width="95"></a></font></b></p>
<p style="margin-left: 25px; margin-right: 25px;" align="justify"><b><font color="#000080" face="Arial"><kw>The
"Moby Duck," their ship of "renown," hurtles all over
Seattle and the Captain's word is His grace, Colin Wilson, Duke of Amberley
gospel. Three crew members that year were sent "home" for unspecified
misdemeanors. There was even a mini-mutiny when some of the crew took the
"duck" to an unscheduled engagement and I went along with them. I
didn't know if I would be sent "home" when the Captain found out I was
party to this piece of insubordination and it was with some trepidation that I
next spoke to him. However, I was forgiven</kw><br><kw>
and was still invited back in subsequent years.</kw></font></b></p>
<p style="margin-left: 25px; margin-right: 25px;" align="justify"><b><font color="#000080" face="Arial"><kw>My
best memory has to be the Torchlight Parade. The sheer volume of the crowd, the
noise and all those floats. Absolutely mind blowing. I have never been so
excited and even now I get a "buzz" whilst waiting [and it always
seems a very long wait] for our turn in the parade. That first year a local
newspaper mounted a campaign to get the Pirates banned but a TV station mounted
an opposite campaign and, as the power of television is so much stronger than
the print medium, (I am not biased even though I own a local TV station in
Cayman) the Seafair Pirates won (without any bloodshed).&nbsp; Another memory of
that year was of pirate Jerry Ceis climbing on the Duck, pretending he was
drunk, and throwing himself backwards into the street only to be caught at the
last moment by a net. How he was able to repeat this stunt time and time again,
never getting hurt is still a mystery.</kw></font></b></p>
<p style="margin-left: 25px; margin-right: 25px;" align="justify"><b><font color="#000080" face="Arial"><kw>My
saddest memories are the deaths of three of my close pirate friends. Marcel
Poelvoorde was my Captain in 1987 the year I was Davy Jones. Only a couple of
years later he was dead. He was one of our most colorful, very quiet normally,
but put him in a pirate outfit and he dressed to kill with "bloody"
make-up a-plenty. Art New also died of cancer around the same time. Art was Davy
Jones in 1988 and then elected a pirate all in his twilight years. A really
great man. Lastly, and most recently, Dave "Dogmeat" Speckhals.
"The Dog" and I got to know each other very well. His favorite cry of
"Rock 'n Roll!" will always be present in my mind. I wrote a play
called "Beirut" and based one of the characters on him (his name was,
of course, "Rock 'n Roll").&nbsp;&nbsp; Last year, suffering from his
illness very badly, Dave was still partying and living life to the full. You
will never be forgotten Dog. Never.</kw></font></b></p>
<p style="margin-left: 25px; margin-right: 25px;" align="justify"><b><font color="#000080" face="Arial"><kw>In
Cayman, quite a few of the Seafair Pirates come down for our National Festival
"Pirates Week." It is so popular with them that, even though there was
a split in the club, (another of my saddest memories) the other group, (I should
say groups as they have split again and again and.... oh dear) they still come
down and have fun.&nbsp; Being now an "old-timer" I have friends in
all of the groups and it is very nice to see everyone again. One of my favorite
memories involving the pirates is the capture of the "Governor." This
part has become my stock in-trade with them. Even though I have not played the
Governor for two years. However, believe it or not, on two of the last three
occasions, the pirates failed to recognize me as the Governor and captured my
deputy instead!&nbsp; On another occasion I had to slow down as I was being
chased around Hog Sty Bay to allow myself to be captured by them! Apparently
they had been partying too much the previous night.</kw></font></b></p>
<p style="margin-left: 25px; margin-right: 25px;" align="justify"><b><font color="#000080" face="Arial"><kw>The
Seafair Pirates is, in my opinion, the best club in the world. When the pirates
are not pirating, they are raising moneys for various charities (normally
associated with children).&nbsp; They are indeed scary (some children are very
frightened) but any tears and screams soon turn to delight when the many gifts
and funny antics are presented immediately afterwards.</kw></font></b></p>
<p style="margin-left: 25px; margin-right: 25px;" align="justify"><b><font color="#000080" face="Arial"><kw>My
proudest moments are serving as Davy Jones and being presented with the title
"The Duke of Amberley." I know, however, that I shall always be known
as "the Gov." Gentlemen, thank you for all the wonderful years and
wonderful memories.</kw></font></b></p>
