      <p class="MsoNormal"><kw>Last night, Elaine and I went to see “The Pirates
      of Penzance” at the Chicago Lyric Opera.</kw><span style="">&nbsp;
      </span><kw>No, “Pirates” isn’t an opera, and no, the Lyric doesn’t
      generally perform light opera (this may have been the first time in its
      48-year history).</kw><span style="">&nbsp; </span><kw>However,
      plans to present an opera by Berliosz fell through and they decided to end
      the season on a lighter and different note…and it worked.</kw></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><kw>The reason it worked, aside from the ability of the
      performers, was the fact that the Lyric presented the operetta in a
      straight manner.</kw><span style="">&nbsp; </span><kw>The
      characters (and actors) took everything they said and did with the utmost
      seriousness, eschewing the “wink-wink, nudge-nudge” aspect of Gilbert
      and Sullivan which is frequently added by amateur company’s which feel,
      wrongly, that it is necessary to let the audience know either when Gilbert
      is being clever (which Gilbert does well enough on his own) or when the
      company is being clever </kw><span style="color: black;"><kw>(usually not nearly half
      as clever as they think they’re being).</kw><o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><kw>Michael
      Yeargan’s</kw></span><span style="color: black;"> </span><span style="color: black;"><kw>sets
      were a mix of minimal and extravagant in a manner which worked quite well.</kw><span style="">&nbsp;
      </span><kw>A painted backdrop and the frame of a building formed the basis for
      the scenery in both acts, with additional pieces…rocks, beach tents,
      walls, curtains…added as appropriate for the different scenes.</kw><span style="">&nbsp;
      </span><kw>These pieces not only added to the feel of the stage but were also
      quite useful as props in a variety of scenes.</kw><o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><kw>Similarly, </kw></span><span style="color: black;"><kw>Dona
      Granata’s</kw></span><span style="color: black;"> </span><span style="color: black;"><kw>costumes
      were quite well done, from the ramshackle look of the pirates to the
      uniform appearance of the police force.</kw><span style="">&nbsp;
      </span><kw>The costumes served to identify the actors and catch the eye
      without detracting from either</kw></span><kw> the action or the libretto.</kw><span style="">&nbsp;
      </span><kw>If the costumes of the leads could have been designed to stand out
      a little more, it is only a minor quibble.</kw></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><kw>The cast, led by Roger Honeywell as Frederic and Neal
      Davies (in his Lyric Opera debut) as Major General Stanley, had an
      excellent handle on their parts, both musically and dramatically.</kw><span style="">&nbsp;
      </span><kw>The Lyric’s Frederic and Mabel (Elizabeth Futral) gave the
      appearance that despite the silly circumstances of their meeting, they
      would actually make a good married couple who respected and supported each
      other’s goals.</kw><span style="">&nbsp; </span><kw>Ruth,
      portrayed by D’Oyly Carte veteran Gillian Knight, has the anticipated
      excellent understanding of her role and its importance as a lynchpin to
      the entire work.</kw><span style="">&nbsp; </span><kw>If Kevin
      Langan’s Pirate King wasn’t quite the swashbuckler the character is
      often portrayed as, he did provide a much more nuanced interpretation of
      the role.</kw><span style="">&nbsp; </span><kw>At times,
      especially during spoken dialogue, it was slightly difficult to hear the
      cast, but it was more an irritation than a problem.</kw></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><kw>In addition to the principals, the Lyric filled the
      stage with chorus.</kw><span style="">&nbsp; </span><kw>Major
      General Stanley had no fewer than twenty-five daughters and at its height,
      the pirate band consisted of at least twenty brigands.</kw><span style="">&nbsp;
      </span><kw>Supernumeries were used sparingly, but effectively in the finales
      to both acts.</kw><span style="">&nbsp; </span><kw>The chorus was
      used to excellent effect not only when they were singing, but also during
      solos, when they added to the scene rather than detracted from the
      soloists, perhaps most notably while hiding in the shadows during
      Stanley’s ballad “Sighing Softly to the River” in the second act.</kw></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><kw>The only other difficulty with the production was the
      inclusion of super titles, although Elaine disagrees with me on this.</kw><span style="">&nbsp;
      </span><kw>I know the operetta by heart and can recite and sing the entire
      thing, so I ignored the super titles.</kw><span style="">&nbsp;
      </span><kw>Elaine commented that they were nice because during some of the
      more complex songs, they enabled her to actually understand the words, not
      an inconsequential issue given how much of the plot of “The Pirates of
      Penzance” moves forward in song.</kw><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span><kw>Similarly, it permitted the audience less familiar with the work to
      get all of Gilbert’s humorous references.</kw><span style="">&nbsp;
      </span><kw>In many cases, because of the super titles, a laugh raced through
      the audience before the singer actually delivered the humorous line,
      nevertheless, it was nice to hear the audience laughing out loud at
      Gilbert and Sullivan.</kw></p>
      <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"><kw>If all Gilbert and Sullivan plays were produced in the
      manner of the Lyric Opera’s production, not necessarily with the same
      lavish production qualities, but with the same respect for the material,
      Gilbert and Sullivan’s works would have a much higher level of
      respectability than they currently have.</kw></span>
