                in the Aegean, the Ionian islands lie just off the west coast 
                of Greece, in the Ionian Sea, at the entrance to the Adriatic. 
                They're believed to be the tips of a submerged mountain chain 
                that runs from the Adriatic to the Peloponnese.</kw><br>
                <p><kw>There are seven main islands (the Greek name for the group 
                  is Eptanissa, 'the seven islands'). Of these, six - Corfu, Paxos, 
                  Ithaca, </kw><a href="lefkada-greece.htm"><kw>Lefkada</kw></a><kw>, </kw><a href="kefalonia-island.htm"><kw>Kefallonia</kw></a><kw> 
                  and</kw><a href="zakynthos-greece.htm"><kw> Zakynthos</kw></a><kw> - are what 
                  most people think of the Ionians. (The seventh, Kythira, is 
                  to the south of the Peloponnese, so far apart from the others 
                  that it doesn't feel part of the same group.) </kw><br>
                  <br><kw>
                  All are lush, mountainous, green (they get lots of rain in winter) 
                  and lovely. They look less typically Greek than other islands 
                  - in fact they feel more Italian, with their slender cypress 
                  trees and old Venetian buildings in shades of pink and ochre 
                  - and they have a softer light than the brightness of the Aegean.

            <td valign="top" width="58%"><div align="justify"><kw>Everywhere there are deep green 
                pine forests, olive and citrus groves and vineyards, and the displays

                The islands largely escaped Ottoman occupation, but were instead 
                invaded by the Venetians and the British, both of whom left their 
                mark in a variety of ways, from architecture to cricket, sewers 
                to ginger beer.</kw><br>

                There's not the same wealth of archaeological remains here that 
                you'll find elsewhere in Greece, but the mythological connections 
                are many. The Ionians are thought to get their name from the Greek 
                goddess Io, one of Zeus's paramours, who passed over here in flight 
                from his jealous wife Hera. </kw><br><kw>
                The island of Ithaca was famously home to Odysseus, he built his 
                ships on Kefallonia, and Corfu was his last stop on his long journey 
                home. The Odysseus connection is reflected in a large number of 
                bars, restaurants and streets named after him throughout the islands.</kw><br><kw>
                Tourism is well established here, especially on </kw><a href="../index.htm"><kw>Corfu</kw></a><kw>, 
                which was one of the first (and is still one of the most popular) 
                Greek islands to attract the British package holiday market.</kw><br>
                <br>
                <a href="zante-greece.htm"><kw>Zakynthos</kw></a><kw>, and to a lesser extent, 
                </kw><a href="kefalonia-greece.htm"><kw>Kefallonia</kw></a><kw> and </kw><a href="lefkada-island.htm"><kw>Lefkada</kw></a><kw>,

                of quieter pockets for those who don't want to join the party 
                crowds.</kw><br><kw>
                Best known, northernmost and greenest of the Ionians, Corfu (or 
                Kerkyra) is also considered by many to be possibly the most beautiful 
                of Greek islands. It has inspired many artists over the years: 
                Goethe, Oscar Wilde, Gerald and Lawrence Durrell, Alfred Sisley 
                and Edward Lear all painted or wrote about it. </kw><br>

            <td><div align="justify"><kw>It's certainly the most developed island, 
                and is hugely popular with the British: half a million of us flock 
                there every summer. However, 80 per cent stick to 20 per cent 
                of the coastline, so you can always find somewhere quiet. It has 
                an attractive, cosmopolitan capital city in </kw><a href="../corfutown.html"><kw>Corfu 
                Town</kw></a><kw>, and over 100 miles of coastline, with dramatic cliffs 
                and beaches (both pebbly and sandy), and famously lovely bays 
                and grottoes near </kw><a href="../resorts/paleokastritsa.html"><kw>Paleokastritsa</kw></a><kw>. 
                Inland, there's plenty to attract walkers, ornithologists and 
                botanists - in spring the wildflower displays are particularly 
                impressive. </kw><br><kw>
                Also renowned for its beauty is Zakynthos (or Zante), most southerly 
                of the Ionians. The Venetians called it "the flower of the 
                Orient". Almost triangular in shape, the island has two green 
                mountainous promontories extending into the sea to form the huge 
                bay of Laganas, an area that's been rather overdeveloped by tourism. 
                The main town (Zakynthos Town) was destroyed by an earthquake 
                in 1953 and since rebuilt - so there's not much to see there.</kw></div></td>

                the north, with its Italianate houses, is a busy summer resort 
                and there are picturesque Venetian fortresses at Kastro and Assos 
                (the latter with great views down over the bay of Myrtos, renowned 
                for its afternoon sun and soft white sand). There are wonderful 
                views, too, from Mount Enos, 5,340ft/1,628metres above sea level, 
                looking out over the island and its neighbours.</kw><br><kw>
                The island is known for its wine, olives and olive oil, and, like 
                Zakynthos, famous for its caves. On the northwest coast it's possible 
                to spot monk seals, rarest of the seal species and highly endangered, 
                mainly because of habitat disruption caused by the tourist trade.</kw><br><kw>
                Across a narrow strait to the east of Kefallonia lies Ithaca (or 
                Ithaki), famously home of Odysseus. Small, sleepy and peaceful, 
                it has no airport, no big modern hotels (the lack of great beaches 
                means it's not very touristy, and visitors should book ahead if 
                they intend to stay), and no swimming pools (water's in short 
                supply). However, it has lovely scenery and is the most mountainous 
                of the islands. </kw></div></td>

                lies at the end of a deep fjord-like bay, with a spectacular harbour 
                approach. Homer fans can explore a number of Odyssey sights, including 
                the Cave of the Nymphs, where it's said that Odysseus hid the 
                gifts bestowed upon him by King Alcinous when he finally returned 
                home long after the end of the Trojan War.</kw><br><kw>
                Tiny but perfectly formed, Paxos (or Paxi) is the smallest of 
                the major Ionians and one of the smallest of all Greek islands. 
                Very simple and undeveloped, it's the place to come if you want

                olive trees (it's a good place to pick up olive oil).</kw><br><kw>
                Paxos has wonderful beaches and translucent waters, and the gorgeous 
                west coast is lined with spectacular cliffs and grottoes accessible 
                only by boat. The villages of Gaios (the capital), Lakka and Longos 
                are all picturesque and charming. The neighbouring tiny island 
                of Antipaxos (Antipaxi) is a quick boat-ride away - go for the 
                beaches and a wander through its renowned vineyards.</kw><br><kw>
                Barely an island at all (it's linked to the mainland by a causeway 
                at the north), Lefkada is green, fertile and deeply traditional 
                at heart - in the inland villages you'll still see old women sitting 
                on doorsteps making lace and old men hanging out at the kafeinion.</kw><br><kw>
                The island is busy with Greek and Italian holiday-makers in mid-summer, 
                and popular with windsurfers who come on pilgrimage to Vassiliki. 
                It has a picturesque capital in the form of Lefkada/Lefkas Town, 
                with its distinctive multicoloured wooden houses, and a popular 
                holiday spot in Nidri, on the east coast.</kw><br><kw>
                From Lefkada, it's easy to drive to the attractions of Epirus

                of Meganisi with its beautiful beaches.</kw><br><kw>
