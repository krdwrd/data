The Falkland Islands are a British possession, way down in the South

Atlantic Ocean off the eastern tip of South America.  There are two

main islands, West and East, and many smaller ones (see </kw><a href="map.html"><kw>Map</kw></a><kw>).  For general information on the Falklands, there are already several very

</kw><img src="images/ficattle.jpg" alt="Cattle" align="right" border="0" height="49" width="100"><kw>

interesting and informative sites available - which you can find under

the appropriate Links section.</kw></font></p>

</font><p><font color="#497848" size="4"><kw>The Islands are complex, with far more to them than just sheep or

penguins, important those are, in their way!   Take time to delve

below the surface,  and you will find there are many pieces to the

</kw><img src="images/fiflower.jpg" alt="Flower" align="left" border="0" height="100" width="75"><kw>

jigsaw of Island life - and not all are easy to fit together.  As with any jigsaw however, it is vital to have all the pieces and fit them together accurately in order to build the full picture.  Miss one out and it doesn't make sense.  Twist one to make it fit and the whole thing just becomes distorted.  Trim a piece that doesn't suit you, ie cheat, and you have a false result.</kw></font></p><font color="#497848" size="4"><br>

This site as a whole is already quite large, and there's no point

trying to re-invent the wheel - so instead of going into detail over 

tourism, geography etc, which are already well covered on the links  provided, we hope to bring you some interesting items that may not have </kw><img src="images/ficollage1.jpg" alt="Puzzle Pieces" align="left" border="0" height="122" width="311"><kw>

appeared so far, and introduce you to people and places you may not already know about. You will also find a lot of information on </kw><a href="camp.html"><kw>life in Camp</kw></a><kw> (the countryside outside the only 

town and capital, Stanley) by reading the other sections in this website, and it is hoped that you will find these interesting.</kw></font></p>



<p><font color="#497848" size="4"><img src="images/fijetski.jpg" alt="Jetski" align="left" border="0" height="75" width="100"><kw>

Looking at Stanley without taking into account the Camp, and vice

versa, make for an incomplete picture of the Islands.  Even the Camp </kw><img src="images/ficoast.jpg" alt="Coast" align="right" border="0" height="57" width="100"><kw>

isn't easy to categorise any more, since the quality of life varies  from farm to farm - largely due to the slow progress of the new road system which has yet to reach some of the more remote areas such as the peninsula on which we live.</kw></font></p>



<p><font color="#497848" size="4"><img src="images/fistanley.jpg" alt="Stanley" align="left" border="0" height="75" width="100"><kw>

This Islands section is divided into appropriate headings such

People, Places, Crafts, Wildlife etc. It is hoped that new pages will be added gradually, when there's an opportunity to interview someone of

interest or take pictures of a particular place that's not featured

elsewhere, so please keep checking back to see what's new.</kw></font></p>

If there is some aspect of the Islands that you feel we or other

sites have missed, and which you would like to know more about, please

email us - or put your comments in the Visitors Book - we will then

try to oblige, or at least pass on the request to the relevant people

</kw><img src="images/fibird.jpg" alt="Oystercatcher" align="right" border="0" height="81" width="100"><kw>

so they can add the missing information to their site.</kw></font></p>



<p><font color="#497848" size="4"><img src="images/fimine.jpg" alt="Minefield Sign" align="left" border="0" height="100" width="85"><kw>

The Falkland Islands are a very special place. Although not Islanders born and bred, we have spent twenty happy years here, feel privileged to live in this remote and lovely part of the world, and hope you will one day visit the Islands to see them for yourself.</kw></font></p>



<p><font color="#497848" size="4"><img src="images/fihook.jpg" alt="Squid Jigger Hook" align="right" border="0" height="100" width="77"><kw>

Meanwhile we hope you enjoy gathering up all the relevant pieces of

</kw><img src="images/fistamps.jpg" alt="Stamps" align="left" border="0" height="73" width="100"><kw>

this engaging puzzle, and that you will find the result as fascinating

as we do.</kw></font></p>
