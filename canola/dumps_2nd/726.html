<span class="story"><p><kw> The Portland Pirates turned it on for a late surge Saturday night, but it was too little too late and their bad start undid them.</kw></p>

<p><kw>

 Early penalty trouble hamstrung the Pirates, who trailed by two goals twice in losing 3-2 to the Lowell Lock Monsters in front of 4,174 at the Cumberland County Civic Center.</kw></p>

<p><kw>

 "We came out flat," said Jason Ulmer. "We took penalties early and it got us out of rhythm. It's tough to build a 2-0 hole. We were able to make a game out of it. But when we don't play 60 minutes, we don't win games."</kw></p>

<p><kw>

 Portland is winless in four games (0-2-2), dropped below .500 for the first time since Dec. 28 and fell into sixth place in the Atlantic Division - out of a playoff spot. Portland will face Lowell again today at Tsongas Arena, and Pirates Coach Tim Army, who benched several players in the second, said he will mull several changes to the lineup. </kw></p>

<p><kw>

 Army reworked his club's lines for Saturday's game in an attempt to untrack a few players offensively. </kw></p>

<p><kw>

 It was an experiment he said he won't try again. Most notably Army broke up Portland's effective checking line of Ulmer, Mike Vigilante and Graham Mink. Army put Mink, his captain, with more skilled offensive linemates Boyd Gordon and Mike Souza to help create some offense. </kw></p>

<p><kw>

 "I'm mad at myself. We were trying to magically create offense. It doesn't work that way. I gave it a chance, but it doesn't work that way," said Army. "I'm more convinced than ever you've got to be solid defensively and your offense works from that."</kw></p>

<p><kw>

 Portland hardly got its game together in the first period after heading to the penalty box three times. The Pirates killed all three and seemed like they'd survive the period.</kw></p>

<p><kw>

 But Mike Zigomanis struck at 17:50, popping a rebound past Maxime Ouellet from the top of the crease to take a 1-0 lead into the second.</kw></p>

<p><kw>

 Portland's game got worse before it got better.</kw></p>

<p><kw>

 In the second, Ouellet made a save on a shot from the point and a rebound popped out. Four red Pirates jerseys were in front of him, along with one white Lowell shirt. Who got the puck? The lone Lock Monster. Brett Lysak made it 2-0 at 3:43.</kw></p>

<p><kw>

 "The first goal took the starch out of us," said Army. "I kind of yelled at them between the first and second. Then we came out and were just in a fog. Bang, two goals. We made some adjustments in the second and then obviously had a real good third."</kw></p>

<p><kw>

 Portland had a chance to tie it with two power plays early in the second, but they shot the puck only one time during each man advantage, and mustered only eight shots in the second.</kw></p>

<p><kw>

 Portland turned it on the third, but it was too late.</kw></p>

<p><kw>

 Mike Pudlick got Portland within one on the power play at 11:08 of the third to make it 2-1.</kw></p>

<p><kw>

 Then Lowell scored again on a miscovered play when a turnover turned into a two-on-one rush, and Martin Sonnenberg finished at 15:55 to make it 3-1.</kw></p>

<p><kw>

 Portland immediately came back off the faceoff.</kw></p>

<p><kw>

 Ulmer finished a give-and-go from Souza that make it 3-2 at 16:12. The Pirates had a few good chances after that but were unable to force overtime.</kw></p>

<p><kw>

 NOTES: J.F. Fortin (back), Tim Branham (back), Brad Parsons (collarbone), Garret Stroshein (healthy), Roman Tvrdon (healthy), Nolan Yonkman (knee) and Brian Sutherby (groin) were Portland's scratches.</kw></p>
