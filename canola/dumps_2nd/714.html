                     <h3><kw>McCain and Iseman</kw></h3>
                     <p class="blogdate"><kw>21 Feb 2008 08:24 am</kw></p>
                     <div class="entry" id="entry-37126">
                                                          <p><kw>Well, </kw><em><kw>The New York Times</kw></em><kw>'s article on </kw><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/21/us/politics/21mccain.html?_r=2&amp;pagewanted=1&amp;hp&amp;oref=slogin"><kw>John McCain's relationship with Vicky Iseman</kw></a><kw> sure did </kw><a href="http://www.time-blog.com/swampland/2008/02/mccain_senior_adviser_responds.html"><kw>make Mark Salter mad</kw></a><kw>. It's often unclear at times, however, what exactly Salter is trying to say. The </kw><em><kw>Times</kw></em><kw> story is a bit odd and innuendo-y, hinting at a sexual relationship between McCain and Iseman but they clearly don't have the goods. Salter says McCain spoke to </kw><em><kw>New York Times</kw></em><kw> editor Bill Keller and "denied any personal 'romantic' involvement with Iseman, and said that he did not 'betray the public trust.'"</kw></p>

<p><kw>Obviously, I don't know whether or not McCain had sex with Iseman. I suppose by "what the meaning of the word 'is' is" standards, he didn't even deny having had sex with Iseman. Certainly it'd be a bit rich of McCain to get outraged that anyone would even </kw><em><kw>suggest</kw></em><kw> that he might engage in sexual improprieties. After all, it's well known that he repeatedly cheated on his first wife Carol, of a number of years, with a variety of women, before eventually dumping her for a much-younger heiress whose family fortune was able to help finance his political career. That's well known, I should say, except to the electorate, who would probably find that this sort of behavior detracts from McCain's "character" appeal.</kw></p>

<p><kw>Meanwhile, there's all this stuff Salter doesn't deny (because, again, it's true) about McCain's questionable ethics. He wrote "letters to government regulators on behalf of the [Iseman's] client," he "often flew on the corporate jets of business executives seeking his support," he resigned as head of a non-profit when "news reports disclosed that the group was tapping the same kinds of unlimited corporate contributions he opposed, including those from companies seeking his favor," his Senate office and his campaign are run by corporate lobbyists, etc. </kw></p>

<p><kw>Meanwhile, there's a </kw><a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2008_02/013167.php"><kw>storm of speculation</kw></a><kw> surrounding the Iseman story, which continues to be a weird lede for the piece, and we'll have to see what else comes out.</kw></p>

<p><kw>Also: Does an affair 8 years ago really torpedo John McCain's campaign?  Even if all the innuendo is backed up by facts and so forth, is this really such a big deal?  Are we really surprised that McCain, of all people, may have had an affair?</kw></p>

The issue is that McCain is already struggling with the "Family Values" (cough!) staunch conservatives. This will only decrease their willingness to support him -- and though they are not going to vote for the Democratic nominee, they are now far more likely to stay home and perhaps find the need to wash their hair come election night.</kw></p>

<p><kw>And in this day of tight political races, it will take a shift of only 1% of these people to the "no vote" category to send McCain straight to election Hell in the generals.</kw></p>

<p><kw>So it's not about how we feel about his personal life that matters, it's how the conservative base feels.</kw></p>

<p><kw>Oh, and did I mention that the likelihood of James Dobson and other conservative leaders fielding a third candidate just quadrupled. But why don't we wait to hear from Rush and Anne on this topic. I can't wait to see how much they campaign for the Democratic candidate.</kw><br>

                                      </p><p><kw>It all goes to hypocrisy. McCain holds himself up as this great oracle of wisdom and virtue (just read the initial response from his campaign: He has NEVER violated the public trust) and for years the press has played along. But as the story lays out very well, he's been ethically challenged throughout his career. I follow politics pretty closely and was surprised just how many times he's gotten into trouble over the years. For me, the affair part is a so-what, except it plays to the fact he's two-faced and seems to believe he can do what he wants with whomever he wants, because he's St. McCain. There's a lot of fodder in this story that has nothing to do with sex. </kw></p>

<p><kw>Right, I mean its one thing to cheat on the original, shopworn wife.  Its another to cheat on the replacement trophy wife.  The family values crowd won't be happy.  On the other hand, I suppose the fact that the trophy wife was stealing from children to feed her drug addiction will reduce people's sympathy for her.</kw></p>

<p><kw>Why? Did Bush lose? No. The racist story was more effective - you think W gives an ethical crap about spreading racial innuendo? Whatever gives you the edge.</kw></p>

<p><kw>I don't think the conservative base cares - most of the people who screamed about Clinton were just partisan wankers. The kind of social conservative who truly gets upset about infidelity probably doesn't like McCain anyway. Now, this may hurt McCain with women, but they will probably go for Obama anyway. Probably the net effect of this story for McCain is positive - any time the "liberal" NYT attacks him, conservatives will feel honour bound to rise to his defense, and may come out to vote for him after all.</kw></p>

<p><kw>On the other hand - if the press plays up the lobbying and the ethics angle rather than the sex, this will hurt McCain with independents, but I'm guessing the press will run with the sex.</kw></p>

<p><kw>He's done some of the usual Republican unsavory things to get where he is today -- and when you step up to the Heavyweights and try to take the title, all those unsavory things are fair game.</kw></p>

<p><kw>I don't count out the power of the wingnut attack machine, or the ability of Rove to create a lie for him that others will believe... but McCain is the politics of the past made flesh.  He's </kw><i><kw>old</kw></i><kw> -- not kindly, Marcus Welby, M.D. Old; but crabby angry bad Henry Fonda On-Golden-Pond Old. </kw></p>

<p><kw>McCain has inconsistent positions and public statements; his involvment in the S&amp;L bailout is being resurrected; his lies are easy to spot; and worst of all, he appears to believe his own press.  He thinks a self-righteous response will cover just about anything. </kw></p>

<p><kw>Most of all, he represents what some (people whom I know, anyway) perceive as the politics of the Republican machine -- a pay-for-play mode of decision-making and vicious, greed-driven, incompetent crony politics. That machine has run the country for nearly two decades. It made Bush their sock puppet, and McCain is strapped to both the GOP machine and Mister 19%(whom he campaigned for, twice). </kw></p>

<p><kw>As a Republican, McCain's claim of being a 'Maverick' won't prevent him from being perceived as Old Mister More Of The Same... and it's summed up in his favorite phrase, "my friends" -- which I think was last used consistently by Harold Stassen. </kw></p>

<p><kw>The sex shouldn't be the point -- that's a "news-as-entertainment" formula.  The real issue is conflict of interest and doing favors for cash.  If there's any sex involved, it's in the metaphor of McCain fluffing his Bud for money.</kw></p>

Right and well said!  I was thinking the same thing. Either Karl Rove lost his touch, or he was just getting lazy and going for the obvious, sure to win, racist allusions. </kw></p>

                                      </p><p><kw>The RNC is going to abandon McCain for Ron Paul?  McCain is a 'typical Replublican'?  Sheesh.  I think I am scared more than ever about the extremist on both sides of the aisle and on this board.  Do the wackos live in some twisted consipiracy world?  Vote or don't vote for the man, but it hard to argue that McCain has been business as usual when it comes to reform or backing the far right nut jobs.</kw></p>

<p><kw>Look, there is plenty to dislike about any candidate, but I can't remember a time in my lifetime where I thought there were so many candidates that had some real qualities I admire.  That doesn't mean that I wanted them as President, but I am grateful for the choice.  I am not likely to vote for a personal injury attorney like Edwards, but that doesn't mean that I don't have a lot of respect for the other things he has done in his career and what he has emphasized while in the public eye.</kw></p>

<p><kw>None of the major candidates deserve the bitter scorn they go through.  (Well, maybe Hillary.  I still can't shake the feeling that she and Bill value the political process more than a great sense of public service, but that may be my impression based on the media.)  I'm glad that there are decent people like McCain (and others) who are willing to suffer the slings and arrows in order to make the country a better place.</kw></p>

<p><kw>Surely the times, if they are going to allege that McCain sold votes, can point out which votes they were.</kw></p>

<p><kw>The article talks about some issues that were in front of the committee that he chaired, and letters that were sent, but doesn't quote from the letters, or name specific votes?</kw></p>

<p><kw>Is it possible that there is no evidence of him throwing a vote?</kw></p>

<p><kw>And if there is evidence, why won't they print it?</kw></p>

                                      </p><p><kw>So the facts:</kw></p>

<p><kw>McCain vs lobbying firm X</kw></p>

<p><kw>McCain got campaign contributions of some non-negligible amount from clients of X, something like 1% of the cost of a single Senatorial campaign</kw></p>

<p><kw>McCain got a charming partner, working for X, for some good time around the town (perhaps just strolling and dining and some such)</kw></p>

<p><kw>McCain was active on the behalf of clients of X.</kw></p>

<p><kw>My conclusion is that McCain perception of the common weal is influenced by factors like: campaign contribution and personal charm of persons presenting cases to consider.  Not something that would justify tar and feather treatment, but a demerit even so.</kw></p>

<p><kw>PS.  It is well known that men, especially of certain age, may feel pleasure of female companionship, especially if of (relatively) young and pretty kind, even if sex is not involved.  For examples, young pretty females are clearly over-represented in sales stuff for drugs and medical equipment, even if doctors who make purchase decisions do not sleep with them (at least, I hope that they do not).  The companies probably know what they do.  And if doctors are influenced by the gender, age and looks of the sales people that is not that good.  My guess that  the gender, age and looks of lobbyists making personal contacts with politicians is similarly skewed, and, unlike in the case of sales people, the lobbyists are encouraged by their employers to have personal friendship with politicians.</kw></p>

<p><kw>PS. PS.  How about "Vote McCain, virile as recently as 8 years ago"?</kw></p>

                                      </p><p><kw>If I have not mistaken something, only these can be considered as true facts in this story: </kw></p>

<p><kw>- Vicki Iseman had spent more time around McCain, what is normal for a professional relationship. </kw><br><kw>
- She thought, she did have influence on McCain. She was sure enough to speak about it.</kw><br><kw>
- Some people close to McCain were worried enough about Iseman to take all, but one of the possible actions to keep her away.</kw></p>

<p><br><kw>
My questions:</kw></p>

<p><kw>- Is it realistic that McCain did not realize that such an attractive lady, who is hard to overlook, was too much around?</kw><br><kw>
- Is it anything of realistic not asking McCain if it was ok with him to take such actions beforehand?</kw><br><kw>
- Is it realistic, that after the people in charge in his campaign had taken some serious actions to keep Iseman away from McCain, they would not warn him too? </kw></p>

<p><kw>The answer for me this far is NO. So he is lying.</kw></p>

<p><kw>But maybe I am missing something. So suppose it is in fact true, that McCain knew nothing about it. </kw></p>

<p><kw>-Why was he left out?  </kw></p>

<p><kw>The only thing I can think of is that they were afraid, that McCain would not listen. And this leads back to the improper relationship.  </kw></p>

<p><kw>But maybe I am still missing something. Really would not want to miss anything of importance, so if there are other possible realistic explanations, I am very much open to suggestions. </kw><br>
