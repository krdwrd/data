	<p><kw> Boats stream across Timbalier Bay as the weather </kw><br><kw>
warms up and dreams of big trout draw anglers to the </kw><br><kw>
barrier islands, but guide Chad Dufrene doesn’t follow the </kw><br><kw>
pack. </kw><br><kw>
Instead, he makes the short run from Bobby Lynn’s to the </kw><br><kw>
first islands between Lake Raccourci and Timbalier Bay.</kw><br>
 </p>
	<p></p><p align="left"><kw>“They’re passing up fish,” Dufrene said. “This is the first </kw><br><kw>
place the fish stop when they leave the marshes.” </kw></p><p align="left"><kw>Besides, he said, fishing Timbalier and East Timbalier islands s a tricky business. </kw></p><p align="left"><kw>“There’s only a handful of days that that you can catch those big fish,” the owner of Dufrene’s Guide Service explained. “If it’s rough, you just can’t do it.” </kw></p><p align="left"><kw>And even on those days when the weather allows big-trout action, Dufrene said it’s just no fun for him. </kw></p><p align="left"><kw>“On any given weekend, there’s so many boats out there. You’ve got to take a number to fish out there,” he said. </kw></p><p align="left"><kw>So he prefers to hop the island chains inside the bay, even if his chances of catching lunkers are small. </kw></p><p align="left"><kw>“I’d rather catch numbers,” he explained. </kw></p><p align="left"><kw>However, May is the best bet for a combination of numbers and size on the scattered islands.</kw></p><p align="left"><kw>“That’s going to last three, four, five weeks,” Dufrene said. “It’s going to be pretty fish — drag-stripping fish.”</kw></p><p align="left"><kw>The fish will run up to about 4 pounds during this early run, and even then, the numbers of these bruisers will be limited.</kw></p><p align="left"><kw>“A 3- to 3 1/2-pound trout is a good fish for us,” he said. “You’re not going to catch a box of 4- to 7-pound trout.</kw></p><p align="left"><kw>“When you catch a 5- or 6-pound trout out here, you might want to mount it.”</kw></p><p align="left"><kw>By early June, however, the bigger fish will pull out to the barrier islands.</kw></p><p align="left"><kw>“The rest of the year, you’re going to catch 12- to 18-inch fish,” Dufrene said.</kw></p><p align="left"><kw>And that’s what draws him to the bay — swarms of trout.</kw></p><p align="left"><kw>But it’s not just a matter of pulling up to any reef or island. Dufrene said it’s often a process of elimination.</kw></p><p align="left"><kw>“You might have to jump around, but you’ll eventually find them,” Dufrene said. “Our fish are always on the move.</kw></p><p align="left"><kw>“You’ve got to be prepared to burn some gas to find fish.”</kw></p><p align="left"><kw>The key is to time trips to coincide with an incoming tide.</kw></p><p align="left"><kw>“The tide pushes green water in,” he said. “When that green water moves in, that bait will move up on the islands, and the fish will follow that bait.”</kw></p><p align="left"><kw>That being said, trout also can be landed during the first couple of hours of a falling tide, Dufrene said.</kw></p><p align="left"><kw>“You’ll catch some fish on an incoming tide, but you’ll catch more in the evening on a falling tide,” he said.</kw></p><p align="left"><kw>So he plans to spend a full day on the water.</kw></p><p align="left"><kw>When fishing visible islands, Dufrene usually looks for cuts that allow the water to flow through, or he’ll set up on a point.</kw></p><p align="left"><kw>“It seems like the bait congregates on those cuts and points better,” he said.</kw></p><p align="left"><kw>Reefs or the submerged remains of eroded islands present many more opportunities, since trout can set up anywhere on the structure to ambush bait.</kw></p><p align="left"><kw>Dufrene said he generally begins upcurrent of structure.</kw></p><p align="left"><kw>“I really like to fish upcurrent because I think that’s where most of the fish will be,” he said. “They sit in that eddy caused by the water passing around or over the island.”</kw></p><p align="left"><kw>Of course, if there already are boats set up, Dufrene might have to work other parts of the structure.</kw></p><p align="left"><kw>His approach to fishing these areas is to be cautious.</kw></p><p align="left"><kw>“You definitely don’t want to run up there and throw an anchor out,” he said. “People do that, and then they wonder why they aren’t catching any fish.”</kw></p><p align="left"><kw>Instead, he shuts down well ahead of time.</kw></p><p align="left"><kw>“I drift in, and find out where the fish are,” Dufrene said. “Sometimes they’re 50 feet off the island; sometimes they’re right on the island.”</kw></p><p align="left"><kw>The veteran guide uses his trolling motor to slowly position the boat for optimal effect.</kw></p><p align="left"><kw>“A trolling motor is the key to trout fishing,” Dufrene said. “I don’t know how people fish without one.”</kw></p><p align="left"><kw>When he gets a couple of bites, Dufrene quietly steps away from the trolling motor, grabs his Cajun anchor and stabs it into the bottom.</kw></p><p align="left"><kw>“It doesn’t make any noise,” he explained.</kw></p><p align="left"><kw>This type of anchor works well in muddy bottoms, but Dufrene said he keeps a traditional bottom-dragging anchor aboard in case he has to fish where the bottom is predominantly sand.</kw></p><p align="left"><kw>“That Cajun anchor doesn’t work too well in sand,” he said.</kw></p><p align="left"><kw>When he’s forced to use a conventional anchor, Dufrene eases it in the water to avoid spooking the school.</kw></p><p align="left"><kw>Once set up on a school, Dufrene said there are two options: tightlined plastics and live bait.</kw></p><p align="left"><kw>His personal preference is the former, but he said that’s not always the best choice.</kw></p><p align="left"><kw>“If you’re (the only boat on an island), you can catch a lot of fish on plastics,” he said. “But if someone shows up with minnows, you have to move to live bait.”</kw></p><p align="left"><kw>Shrimp are almost impossible to find in the Golden Meadow/Leesville area, so the baitfish of choice for area anglers is cocahoes.</kw></p><p align="left"><kw>But even when fish hit plastics, a switch to live bait is sometimes warranted.</kw></p><p align="left"><kw>“When you’re catching fish on plastics and the bite slows down, you can switch to a minnow and get them going again,” Dufrene said.</kw></p><p align="left"><kw>At that point, the plastics can generally be tossed aside, but Dufrene said there are times when he’ll still catch a few on artificial offerings.</kw></p><p align="left"><kw>“If you’ve got two or three people using plastics, and that really gets the school going, one person can throw a plastic out and catch them,” he said. “At that point, it doesn’t make a difference.”</kw></p><p align="left"><kw>Effective colors for clear-water situations include smoke/red glitter and glow/chartreuse.</kw></p><p align="left"><kw>“The smoke looks like brown shrimp, and the glow color looks like white shrimp,” Dufrene said. Black/chartreuse and purple/chartreuse are equally effective in dingy water.</kw></p><p align="left"><kw>“The fish can just see them so much better.”</kw></p><p align="left"><kw>He prefers the 3 1/2-inch ReAction Chubs over larger versions of the artificial lures.</kw></p><p align="left"><kw>“You’re going to miss too many smaller fish,” Dufrene said. “There just aren’t enough big trout out there to target them.”</kw></p><p align="left"><kw>When it comes to live bait, Dufrene said he doesn’t mess with Carolina rigs.</kw></p><p align="left"><kw>Instead, he just rips off his plastic lure and punches the jighead’s point through a minnow’s lip.</kw></p><p align="left"><kw>“I just throw it out there and bump it along like a plastic worm,” he said. “They’ll bump it just like a bass and start swimming off with it.”</kw></p><p align="left"><kw>He uses only 1/4-ounce jigheads.</kw></p><p align="left"><kw>“You don’t need anything heavier than that,” he said. “You don’t have that kind of current in the bay: It’s just so wide open and big.”</kw></p><p align="left"><kw>And Dufrene doesn’t want the big magnum minnows. He likes those that are 2 to 3 inches long.</kw></p><p align="left"><kw>“The bigger ones don’t mean bigger fish, I’ll tell you that,” he said. “I find they eat those little minnows better.”</kw></p><p align="left"><kw>Water depth really isn’t much of an issue for the bay, he said.</kw></p><p align="left"><kw>“The deepest water you’re going to find in the bay is probably 7 to 12 feet,” Dufrene said. “So it doesn’t really matter how deep the water is.”</kw></p><p align="left"><kw>Therefore, he’ll fish around any island or over any reef no matter how much water surrounds it.</kw></p><p align="left"><kw>“I just pay attention to the water,” Dufrene said. “I’m looking for bait and slicks.”</kw></p><p align="left"><kw>What he seldom pays attention to are diving birds.</kw></p><p align="left"><kw>“We don’t fish a lot of birds,” he explained. “Most of the time, those birds in the open water are over small fish.”</kw></p><p align="left"><kw>So he normally just passes by feeding flocks of gulls.</kw></p><p align="left"><kw>The only exception is when birds are feeding near his target areas.</kw></p><p align="left"><kw>“The only time I fish birds is when they’re diving on flats or near an island,” Dufrene said. “If you find birds in shallow water, you’ll catch bigger fish.”</kw></p><p align="left"><kw>But water clarity is a critical factor.</kw></p><p align="left"><kw>Fortunately, the bay has a cycle that makes the hunt for trout a logical pursuit.</kw></p><p align="left"><kw>And it all starts on the eastern side of the bay.</kw></p><p align="left"><kw>“The fish show up earlier southeast of Lake Raccourci in Pelican Pass,” Dufrene said. “It always cleans up first there.”</kw></p><p align="left"><kw>That’s because the tide floods through the cuts in the barrier islands, and Pelican Pass offers the easiest route for the clean, Gulf water.</kw></p><p align="left"><kw>So the first stops will be a group of islands on the east side of the pass, marking the boundary between the pass and Jacko Camp Bay.</kw></p><p align="left"><kw>Two of these unnamed islands are visible, and two are submerged due to erosion.</kw></p><p align="left"><kw>“Usually, it cleans up here first thing in the morning,” Dufrene said.</kw></p><p align="left"><kw>So when his Blazer Bay cuts through the marsh and out of Little Lake, Dufrene turns it directly toward these fish-rich waters.</kw></p><p align="left"><kw>In addition to the islands along the eastern edge of Pelican Pass, Dufrene will often run to an old camp pad at the mouth of Pierle Bay just to the southeast.</kw></p><p align="left"><kw>“It’s marked with big creosote pilings,” Dufrene said. “It used to be an old camp, and there’s just a big shell reef left there now.”</kw></p><p align="left"><kw>Once he’s thoroughly probed these areas, Dufrene will turn his eyes west.</kw></p><p align="left"><kw>He can begin by hopping right across Pelican Pass to Caporn Point, a submerged island just to the east-northeast of Philo Brice Island.</kw></p><p align="left"><kw>The northern tip of Northwest Island also is a good option.</kw></p><p align="left"><kw>His next choice depends upon what he finds there.</kw></p><p align="left"><kw>“If I’m coming across the bay and see the water’s green, I know there will be fish on the southwest part of Fornation,” Dufrene said.</kw></p><p align="left"><kw>But if the water hasn’t quite made the change yet on Northwest Island, Dufrene heads southwest to Casse-tete Island.</kw></p><p align="left"><kw>“The western tip is really the best part of the island,” he said. “The bait sweeps around that point, and the fish stack up right there.”</kw></p><p align="left"><kw>Moving farther west, Dufrene makes stops at Brush Island, which is chopped up into several pieces.</kw></p><p align="left"><kw>The western tip of the main island has excellent fishing, Dufrene said.</kw></p><p align="left"><kw>“There’s a cut right there, and that’s the best place on the island,” he said.</kw></p><p align="left"><kw>He works the Gulf side of the island, moving back and forth until he locates a school.</kw></p><p align="left"><kw>But he also finds fish around the northeastern tip of the island. This tip is actually a big grassy island now.</kw></p><p align="left"><kw>If his customers still haven’t finished off their limits, Dufrene said he can generally pick up some fish in the canals on the backside of Timbalier Island.</kw></p><p align="left"><kw>“If the mullet are present, the fish are going to be in there,” he said.</kw></p><p align="left"><kw>This pattern lasts through May or early June, when the trout begin looking for cooler water.</kw></p><p align="left"><kw>“That’s when they move onto the platforms in the bay,” Dufrene said. “They start moving to deeper water.”</kw></p><p align="left"><kw>The Caillou Island chain is a prime target during the transition, but by the end of June and into July, the trout have moved solidly onto the platforms north of Caillou Island and west of Fornation.</kw></p><p align="left"><kw>Until then, however, Dufrene will be running from one island to the next to stay on the schoolies for which Timablier Bay is known.</kw></p><p align="left"><em><kw>Capt.
