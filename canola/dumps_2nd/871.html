        <font color="#808000"><kw>Just north of the tropic of Capricorn, Great
      Keppel Island is the tropic of fun. Most of the island is a national park,
      with 28km (18 miles)of beaches, wide stretches of sand and small secluded
      bays. For snorkelling or diving, apart from Clam Bay Shelving beach and
      Monkey Point, there's nine great diving sites on Capricorn Reef alone.
      Nearby North West Island is the largest Coral Cay on The Great Barrier
      Reef covering an area of ninety-one hectares. It's also an important
      nesting place for green turtles during the summer months.</kw></font>
      <p><font color="#808000"><kw>The
      eighteen </kw><b><kw>Keppel Islands</kw></b><kw> boast white sand so fine that it squeaks
      when you walk through it, and the sea is an invitingly clear blue – just
      right for a few days of indolence. Most of the islands are national parks
      and, with the exception of North and Great Keppel, are very small. Easy
      access, coupled with a resort and associated facilities, has made </kw><b><kw>Great
      Keppel</kw></b><kw> the most popular, but there are also reefs to snorkel and
      isolated camping spots on the other islands.</kw></font></p>

      (tel 07/4933 6244). For </kw><b><kw>Great Keppel</kw></b><kw>, </kw><i><kw>Reefcat,</kw></i> <i><kw>Spirit of
      Keppel</kw></i><kw> and </kw><i><kw>Keppel Kat</kw></i><kw> run a total of four daily return services
      from the ferry terminal (last leaves Great Keppel at 4.30pm), plus a late
      service on Fridays; all charge $27 return. The marina is also the place to
      find transport to </kw><b><kw>other islands</kw></b><kw>, or </kw><b><kw>cruises</kw></b><kw> beyond them; </kw><i><kw>Reef
      Chief</kw></i><kw> and </kw><i><kw>Euphoria</kw></i><kw> are among boats running charter trips

      at </kw><b><kw>Great Keppel</kw></b><kw>, the ferry leaves you on a spit directly in front
      of the budget </kw><b><kw>accommodation</kw></b><kw> choices. Along
      the beach, the modern and comfortable </kw><i><kw>Great Keppel Island Resort</kw></i><kw>,
      or rather its </kw><i><kw>Wreck Bar,</kw></i><kw> is the island’s after-dark social focus;
      by day, the resort cultivates a family atmosphere and there’s a pool for
      day-trippers. Aside from the YHA and </kw><i><kw>Backpackers,</kw></i><kw> all of the above
      offer substantial savings on </kw><b><kw>packages</kw></b><kw> or </kw><b><kw>stand-by rates</kw></b><kw>,
      which are well worth checking out in advance. For food, </kw><i><kw>Keppel Haven</kw></i><kw>
      has a </kw><b><kw>restaurant</kw></b><kw> and occasional barbecues, and there’s a tearoom
      at the </kw><i><kw>Shell House</kw></i><kw> on Fisherman’s Beach. There is also a
      late-opening </kw><b><kw>pizza shack</kw></b><kw> – much frequented after the bar closes.</kw></font>
      <p><font color="#808000"><kw>The main </kw><b><kw>beaches</kw></b><kw>, Putney and
      Fisherman’s, are remarkably pleasant considering the number of people
      lounging on them at any one time, but the effort of a half-hour walk will
      reward you with some more secluded spots. </kw><b><kw>Leakes Beach</kw></b><kw> seldom hosts
      more than a handful of people; the quickest way there is up a steep path
      over the point at the rocky end of Putney. Reached on a woodland path past
      the resort, </kw><b><kw>Long Beach</kw></b><kw> attracts a few more sun-worshippers, while
      snorkellers make the short haul over sand dunes at the western end to
      shallow coral on </kw><b><kw>Monkey Beach</kw></b><kw>. Shell mounds on Monkey Beach were
      left by Woppaburra Aborigines, who were enslaved and forcibly removed to
      Fraser Island by early settlers.</kw></font></p>
      <p><font color="#808000"><b><kw>Inland</kw></b><kw> is dry, and the paths double as 4WD
      tracks for the island’s few vehicles. For views, take the road behind
      the resort up a short and steep hill to the lookout. The best walk is the
      hour-long return trip up </kw><b><kw>Mount Wyndham</kw></b><kw>, ending on a cliff with the
      coast below. Longer excursions to Butterfish Bay, Wreck Beach or Bald Rock
      Point lighthouse and back will take at least four hours.</kw></font></p>

      only way of getting to these islands is to contact the marina and enquire
      about boat charters; once you’re there, there are no </kw><b><kw>provisions</kw></b><kw>,
      and there is (unreliable) </kw><b><kw>drinking water</kw></b><kw> only on Humpy and North
      Keppel. NPWS camping </kw><b><kw>permits</kw></b><kw> can be picked up at the Rockhampton or
      Rosslyn Bay offices.</kw></font>
      <p><font color="#808000"><b><kw>North Keppel</kw></b><kw> is an undeveloped version of
      Great Keppel. There’s an NPWS campsite on the west side of the island,
      behind the dunes at Considine Bay, with a sporadic supply of tank water,
      showers and toilets; take precautions against sandflies, which are
      abundant in sheltered spots here, and note that wood fires are banned. A
      walking track from the group of cabins at the southern end of Considine
      Beach leads to the reef at Maisy Bay. Just to the south, </kw><b><kw>Pumpkin Island</kw></b><kw>
      is a privately owned area of beach, mangroves and coral with four basic
      but smart cabins</kw></font></p>
      <p><font color="#808000"><b><kw>Middle Island</kw></b><kw> is lightly wooded, with an
      NPWS camping area and </kw><b><kw>underwater observatory</kw></b><kw> complete with scenic
      Taiwanese junk. It’s only a short hop from Great Keppel, and you might
      be able to pick up a day-trip from there to the observatory. If you plan
      to dive at Olive Head Point, watch out for sea snakes. </kw><b><kw>Humpy Island</kw></b><kw>,
      also off Great Keppel, is popular for fishing and has the best snorkelling
      reef of all the islands. The hump doesn’t do much to protect it from the
      southeasterlies, which are the main problem with camping here; facilities
      are similar to those on North Keppel.</kw></font>
