The Marine Research Fleet of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Far East 
Branch, is:
</kw><p>
</p><ul>
<li><kw>An exclusive organization in the Russian Far East that promotes basic 
and applied studies of the world ocean along different lines of modern 
oceanographic research by all the scientific institutions of the Russian 
Academy of Sciences;
</kw><p>
</p></li><li><kw>The only Far Eastern organization capable of conducting basic experimental 
research and applied studies, using modern and newly designed systems, 
equipment, and devices in any location of the world ocean in all areas of 
marine science;
</kw><p>
</p></li><li><kw>The largest Russian research fleet, whose port of registration is the 
Bay of the Golden Horn in Vladivostok, with privately owned, fully equipped 
berthing;
</kw><p>
</p></li><li><kw>An onshore base of operations for all vessels of the fleet, providing a 
complete source of supplies, small repairs, and outfitting of ships destined 
for marine expeditions of all kinds;
</kw><p>
</p></li><li><kw>An organization of highly skilled, professional crews, commanded by 
graduates of Russian marine academies, fully skilled in the navigation of 
all classes of vessels, and ample experience to lead scientific expeditions, 
and to conduct scientific investigations.

<img src="../Img/cleardot.gif" align="left" hspace="8"><kw>The Marine Research 
Fleet was originally established as a Department of the Far East Science 
Center of the Academy of Sciences in 1973, with only three vessels at its 
disposal.  Today it is an independent organization with 20 modern research 
vessels of various classes and ocean-going capabilities.  These vessels are 
organized into three main groups based on their structure and technical 
parameters:  (1) multipurpose vessels with unlimited geographic range, 
(2) vessels with limited geographic range, and (3) regional or local 
coastal vessels.
</kw></p><p>
<img src="../Img/cleardot.gif" align="left" hspace="8"><kw>Eight vessels with 
unlimited geographic range, built at Russian, Finnish, and Polish shipyards, 
constitute the nucleus of the fleet.  These vessels are equipped with modern 
navigation and scientific equipment enabling them to carry out the most 
complicated and most diverse scientific research anywhere throughout the 
world ocean.  These eight ships are as follows:

<img src="../Img/cleardot.gif" align="left" hspace="8"><kw>The Marine Research 
Fleet of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Far East Branch, 
supports marine expeditions in the areas of oceanography, geophysics, biology, 
and biochemistry in practically any location throughout the world ocean that 
is of interest to the Russian Academy of Sciences.  We lease our vessels and 
crews for research and exploitation of the ocean on a mutually beneficial 
basis.  The Fleet Administration invites all parties concerned with joint or 
independent research, organizing marine expeditions both in Russia and abroad, 
to consider our proposals to lease vessels and associated service while at 
sea and ashore.  We provide for the complete preparation of vessels and 
expeditions, including mounting and installation of all equipment and 
instruments.  We also provide for various marine guided tours around the 
waters of the Peter the Great, Ussuri and Amur bays, as well as around the 
islands, picturesque inlets, and the marine preserves of the greater 
Vladivostok region.
