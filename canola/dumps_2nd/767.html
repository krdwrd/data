<p><span lang="en-us"><kw>Shanghai</kw></span></p>
<p><span lang="en-us"><kw>Our last port of call we could tour before the end of our 
cruise.&nbsp; We traveled down a portion of the Yangtze River until we reached 
the YingPo River.&nbsp; All along the river banks where there were once rice 
paddies are now container cranes and docks filling container ships for transport 
throughout the world. Ship traffic was heavy. We entered the channel early in 
the morning and yet it was nearly 5:00 before we actually docked in Shanghai.&nbsp; 
We didn't plan anything for that night although we could have gone to watch 
Chinese acrobats.&nbsp; </kw></span></p>
<p><span lang="en-us"><kw>The following morning we boarded buses to tour Shanghai, 
especially the old foreign enclave areas of the British and French.&nbsp; Even 
in 2006 there are still buildings bearing their distinctive style.&nbsp; Mr. 
Wong said many of the old buildings are being torn down in favor of more hotels 
and apartment buildings.&nbsp; Apartment buildings reach upwards to 60 stories 
high.&nbsp; Traffic is horrendous in Shanghai, cars, bikes, motor-scooters, 
cycles, buses, trucks, but we did like their traffic light system.&nbsp; The 
green light flashed to indicate it would be turning red shortly.&nbsp; Also when 
the expressway got too full they turned on no entrance signs until it cleared a 
bit.&nbsp; Traffic was congested but it did move.</kw></span></p>
<p><span lang="en-us"><kw>Our first stop was at the Mandarin House.&nbsp; We left 
the bus and walked along a park where people were dancing the waltz while others 
were begging.&nbsp; A city of great contrast for sure.&nbsp; We went through a 
retail area that looked interesting, we all wanted to shop but were told no.&nbsp; 
The Chinese government doesn't support the independent retailers and wanted us 
to shop at the Friendship Stores.&nbsp; </kw></span></p>
<p><span lang="en-us"><kw>The Mandarin House was located just beyond the shopping 
area.&nbsp; A large pond or small lake was at it's entrance.&nbsp; The house was 
originally owned by a Chinese noble but when the foreigners came they took it, 
later the Chinese government took it and eventually made it into a museum. Mr. 
Wong said&nbsp; that if the garden path was straight it would take you 6 minutes 
to walk through the gardens, it took us over 30 with the way it wound around but 
oh the gardens were beautiful.&nbsp; All the gardens we saw were very well 
tended, in fact people were working on them when we visited.</kw></span></p>
<p><span lang="en-us"><kw>From the Mandarin House we went to the Shanghai Museum.&nbsp; 
The Chinese seem to favor oddly shaped buildings and yet it was different and 
gave the cities a unique character.&nbsp; Shanghai was no different.&nbsp; The 
museum was shaped like a cooking pot with handles.&nbsp; Mr. Wong said if you 
looked down from a helicopter you could see its shape and be able to look down 
through the building like you do a pot.&nbsp; Interesting statues lined the 
front of the building and inside was an eclectic collection of various displays 
ranging from bronze items through precious gem pieces.&nbsp; We didn't take any 
photos but we saw magnificent Chinese pottery, jade, statues, etc.&nbsp; We 
started at the top and worked our way down.</kw></span></p>
<p><span lang="en-us"><kw>We ate lunch at the Ji Jiang Hotel.&nbsp; Excellent food.&nbsp; 
From there we went to the Friendship Store where we bought the last of our 
souvenir purchases.&nbsp; Guess I must have spent a lot more in those stores 
because the manager thanked me, but it was hard not to, they had nice 
merchandise at a reasonable price.</kw></span></p>
<p><span lang="en-us"><kw>We finished off our tour at the Children's Palace, a place 
where parents bring their children to learn art, dance, music, whatever after 
school.&nbsp; It's all free to the people.&nbsp; We were entertained by six 5 
year olds; 2 played piano, 1 the violin, 1 the cello, 3 playing different 
Chinese instruments.&nbsp; They were cute and very good.&nbsp; I bought my only 
panda piece there a picture drawn by a 9-13 year and if you didn't know a child 
drew and painted it you wouldn't have believed it.&nbsp; The nice thing about 
the picture is, the money goes right back into the school.</kw></span></p>
<p><span lang="en-us"><kw>Getting back to the ship was an adventure in itself.&nbsp; 
Rush hour traffic was worse than here in Orlando.&nbsp; We had been told to be 
back aboard ship by 5:45, we were a little late but thankfully the ship didn't 
leave port until nearly 8:30 p.m.&nbsp; We were able to get the night shots of 
the river traffic which was just as bad as the road traffic.&nbsp; We were 
eating dinner as we began our trip back down the Yangtze to the Straits of 
Taiwan and Hong Kong.</kw></span></p>
